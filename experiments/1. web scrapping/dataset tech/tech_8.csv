Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community.

Zack Snyder's Justice League re-cut headed for HBO Max,"HBO Max has announced it will air a re-versioned edition of the superhero film Justice League.The new cut will be done by the film's original director Zack Snyder, who left the production of the film before it was finished due to a family tragedy.Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers, was brought in to complete the film, but fans complained he made the film too light-hearted. HBO's announcement comes a week before the release its new streaming service.Warner Media, which produced Justice League, is also the parent company of HBO.Competition among streaming services has heated up over the last year as more companies have entered the field.Announcing content with Hollywood A-listers has been one way that services have tried to attract subscribers. Many fans have been calling for a ""Snyder-cut"" of Justice League since the film was released in 2017.  Synder completed most the filming for the movie based on the DC Comic Book. But he stepped away from the project before post-production and editing work following the suicide of his daughter.Whedon, who created the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, did several reshoots and fans suggested he gave the film a lighter tone than Synder's original intent.On social media, the hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut has been used by fans calling for a new version of the film.It is not yet known whether the new version, set to be released in 2021 will be a six-part series or a nearly four-hour long directors-cut film.HBO Max is not the only service looking to big names or familiar franchise to attract subscribers.Earlier this week Apple TV Plus announced it would premier the Tom Hanks' film Greyhound, developed by Sony Pictures. The film was set to have a theatrical release in June, but executives changed course because of concern the coronavirus pandemic would keep viewers away from cinemas. When Disney Plus launched in November, it promoted its new Star Wars series The Mandalorian.Short-form streaming app Quibi spent billions on new programming featuring stars ranging from actress Sophie Turner to Chance the Rapper and celebrity chef Evan Funke.More competition is entering the streaming market as well. NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock will make its debut in July.  HBO Max begins service in the US on 27 May.",21 May 2020,technology
Man sentenced to death in Singapore via Zoom,"A man has been sentenced to death via a Zoom video call in Singapore, as the country remains on lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Punithan Genasan, 37, received the sentence on Friday for his role in a drug deal that took place in 2011. It marks the city's first case where such a ruling has been done remotely. Human rights groups argued that pursuing the death penalty at a time when the world is being gripped by a pandemic was ""abhorrent"". The vast majority of court hearings in Singapore have been adjourned until at least 1 June, when the city's current lockdown period is due to end.Cases which have been deemed to be essential are being held remotely. ""For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,"" a spokesperson for Singapore's Supreme Court told Reuters. Mr Genasan's lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client is considering an appeal.Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drugs. In 2013, 18 people were executed - the highest figure in at least two decades, according to Amnesty International. Of those 18, 11 had been charged with drug-related offences.Anna Jones, BBC News, SingaporeSingapore prides itself on its low crime rate and is fiercely anti-drugs, with a zero-tolerance approach to drug trafficking.Until recently, drug trafficking was one of four crimes that brought a mandatory death sentence. Judges can now reduce that to life with caning, under certain conditions. The government maintains that hanging drug traffickers sends a powerful message of deterrence against a socially destructive crime.Human rights campaigners have long argued that the process is too secretive, and say that executions disproportionately target low-level drug mules, while doing little to stop the flow of drugs into the country. Among Singaporeans, however, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. Executions rarely get prominent coverage in the national media, and opinion polls consistently show overwhelming public support for the death penalty in some form, making the few anti-death penalty campaigners a fringe group.In a country where the media is rarely overtly critical of government decisions, there is unlikely to be much of a public outcry over Punithan Genasan's fate being decided by video call.Kirsten Han, a Singaporean journalist and activist, said: ""The delivering of a death sentence via Zoom just highlights how clinical and administrative capital punishment is."" She added that by bypassing a courtroom appearance, the accused's family had missed out on an opportunity to speak and hold hands with him.Amnesty International said the ruling was a ""reminder that Singapore continues to defy international law and standards by imposing the death penalty for drug trafficking. “At a time when the global attention is focused on saving and protecting lives in a pandemic, the pursuit of the death penalty is all the more abhorrent.""Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: ""It's shocking the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to confront his accusers.""Singapore officials are not the first to issue a death penalty over a video conference call. Human Rights Watch condemned a similar ruling made in Nigeria earlier this month. Lagos judge Mojisola Dada sentenced Olalekan Hameed to death by hanging for the murder of his employer's mother.Hameed had pleaded not guilty to killing 76-year-old Jolasun Okunsanya in December 2018.""The irreversible punishment is archaic, inherently cruel and inhuman. It should be abolished,"" Human Rights Watch told the BBC at the time. ",20 May 2020,technology
Man makes money buying his own pizza on DoorDash app,"The owner of a pizza restaurant in the US has discovered the DoorDash delivery app has been selling his food cheaper than he does - while still paying him full price for orders.A pizza for which he charged $24 (£20) was being advertised for $16 on DoorDash - and when he secretly ordered it himself, the app paid his restaurant the full $24 while charging him $16.He had not asked to be put on the app.He later found out it was part of a trial to gauge customer demand.Content strategist Ranjan Roy blogged about the anonymous restaurateur, who is his friend.Mr Roy said he first heard about the situation in March 2019, when his friend started receiving complaints about deliveries, even though his outlets did not deliver.At that point , he discovered he had been added to DoorDash - and noticed it was charging a lower price for one of his premium pizzas.So he ordered 10 pizzas, paid $160 and had them delivered to a friend's house. The restaurant was then paid $240 for the order by DoorDash.The next time, the restaurant prepared his friend's order by boxing up the pizza base without any toppings, maximising the ""profit"" from the mismatched prices.""I was genuinely curious if DoorDash would catch on - but they didn't,"" wrote Mr Roy.DoorDash did not respond to BBC News's request for comment.But Mr Roy said: ""We found out afterward that was all the result of a 'demand test' by DoorDash.""They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant's website and don't charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed on to the platform.""Third-party delivery platforms, as they've been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they've been subsidised into market dominance.""You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model.""DoorDash is backed by investment giant Softbank, which this week posted a record-breaking loss of nearly $13bn. Defending the loss, chief executive Masayoshi Son reportedly compared himself to Jesus. The billionaire is said to have stated during a call with investors that Jesus was ""also misunderstood"". He later apologised.",20 May 2020,technology
Funding the future during the pandemic,"Are you the owner of a fast-growing UK tech firm worried about keeping going during the current health crisis? Well you had better get your skates on - the Treasury is offering a £250m loan scheme for firms like yours and the money could be gone soon.When the idea of some kind of government help for the UK tech sector was floated in early April, it did not get a universally warm welcome. A letter from a dozen tech entrepreneurs to the Chancellor may not have helped - it was pointed out that several of them had received huge amounts of backing from overseas venture capital funds and did not appear to need support from the taxpayer.There were also warnings from some in the venture capital world that it was a bad idea for the government to try to pick winners in an area where many fledgling firms crash and burn even in the good times.But the Future Fund, launched this morning, appears to have dealt with the concerns of most of the critics. Fast-growing companies can apply for loans of between £125,000 and £5m, as long as they have investors willing to supply matching funds. ""We know that there has been a shock to the system, and we're hoping that we can help build some confidence,"" Treasury Minister Kemi Badenoch told me this morning.I put it to her that many of the early-stage firms in the tech and life sciences sectors were earning little or no revenue before the pandemic - so what had really changed? ""The crisis has affected their ability to access investment,"" she said. ""And we just want to unlock that investment for high-potential companies that will drive the future economy.""One company that has already applied to the fund told me that was exactly its situation - a short-term funding gap. Dave Ranyard's virtual reality gaming start-up Dream Reality Interactive is in one of the few sectors that is doing well at the moment. But the company still failed to raise quite as much money as it expected in March, from investors taking advantage of the government's existing Enterprise Investment Scheme: ""The markets were all shaky, people's net worth dropped because the stock market dropped. And so less of that  EIS money was placed.""Mr Ranyard says other schemes like the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans (CBILS) have not been suitable for tech firms, so they are giving the Future Fund a go. ""It's one of many things that we're trying, I think it could work well for us,"" he says. There appears to be little downside for the company, which has three years to pay back the loan - although the government could end up owning a chunk of the business: ""There are some things that come back to haunt you in three years,"" the entrepreneur says. ""But that's three years away - if we're still open then, I'll be happy.""The venture capitalist Robin Klein was among those who had been concerned that the government could end up trying to pick winners, but he is pleased with the way the scheme has turned out. The key, he says, is that companies need to have investors matching what the government puts in: ""They need committed, involved investors, and therefore having the government Invest alongside those types of investors will mean that we're finding the right companies.""The £250m going into the fund is a relatively modest amount -  the government's furlough scheme is costing  £14bn a month. If all the applicants wanted the full £5m, just fifty firms would be helped. Still, Kemi Badenoch says if demand proves high, then the Treasury will see what more can be done. Today has seen Rolls-Royce - for decades probably the UK's most important technology business - announce thousands of job losses. If those jobs are to be replaced, then fast-growing firms in sectors from video games to life sciences may need to be helped through these challenging times.",20 May 2020,technology
Apple and Google release marks 'watershed moment' for contact-tracing apps,"Apple and Google have released a software tool that will make it possible for nations to release coronavirus contact-tracing apps that adopt the firms' privacy-centric model.It offers developers access to added Bluetooth functionality to solve a problem existing apps have of iPhones sometimes failing to detect each other.Android and iOS device owners will have to carry out system upgrades.But some countries - including the UK - are pursuing a different approach.""The release of these APIs [application programming interfaces] along with the operating-system updates will be a watershed moment for the development and adoption of proximity-tracing apps,"" said Marcel Salathé, an epidemiologist at the Swiss research institute EPFL.He added that apps that adopted the protocol should be able to be made ""interoperable"" - meaning that citizens can continue to be contact-traced as they cross from one region and/or country to another. That could potentially help reduce travel restrictions imposed because of the virus - at least for those using the apps involved.Apple and Google said public health agencies from 22 countries and some US states had already asked to test the system.The app was not ""a silver bullet"" - but ""user adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use"".Contact-tracing apps are designed to automatically log when two people come into proximity to each other for a significant amount of time.If one is later diagnosed with the coronavirus, the other can be given an alert, which might suggest they self-isolate and/or request a medical test of their own.But the authorities believe adoption has been hampered by two factors:In theory, the new system should address both these issues.Its ""decentralised"" approach locates contact-matching on devices themselves rather than a centrally controlled computer server.And this aims to cut the risk of either hackers or the authorities using the database of who met whom and for how long for other purposes.But the UK's NHS and its counterparts in France, Norway and India say the centralised approach gives them greater insight, making it easier to tweak the risk model that decides who receives which type of alert.

Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community.

Man sentenced to death in Singapore via Zoom,"A man has been sentenced to death via a Zoom video call in Singapore, as the country remains on lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Punithan Genasan, 37, received the sentence on Friday for his role in a drug deal that took place in 2011. It marks the city's first case where such a ruling has been done remotely. Human rights groups argued that pursuing the death penalty at a time when the world is being gripped by a pandemic was ""abhorrent"". The vast majority of court hearings in Singapore have been adjourned until at least 1 June, when the city's current lockdown period is due to end.Cases which have been deemed to be essential are being held remotely. ""For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,"" a spokesperson for Singapore's Supreme Court told Reuters. Mr Genasan's lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client is considering an appeal.Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drugs. In 2013, 18 people were executed - the highest figure in at least two decades, according to Amnesty International. Of those 18, 11 had been charged with drug-related offences.Anna Jones, BBC News, SingaporeSingapore prides itself on its low crime rate and is fiercely anti-drugs, with a zero-tolerance approach to drug trafficking.Until recently, drug trafficking was one of four crimes that brought a mandatory death sentence. Judges can now reduce that to life with caning, under certain conditions. The government maintains that hanging drug traffickers sends a powerful message of deterrence against a socially destructive crime.Human rights campaigners have long argued that the process is too secretive, and say that executions disproportionately target low-level drug mules, while doing little to stop the flow of drugs into the country. Among Singaporeans, however, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial. Executions rarely get prominent coverage in the national media, and opinion polls consistently show overwhelming public support for the death penalty in some form, making the few anti-death penalty campaigners a fringe group.In a country where the media is rarely overtly critical of government decisions, there is unlikely to be much of a public outcry over Punithan Genasan's fate being decided by video call.Kirsten Han, a Singaporean journalist and activist, said: ""The delivering of a death sentence via Zoom just highlights how clinical and administrative capital punishment is."" She added that by bypassing a courtroom appearance, the accused's family had missed out on an opportunity to speak and hold hands with him.Amnesty International said the ruling was a ""reminder that Singapore continues to defy international law and standards by imposing the death penalty for drug trafficking. “At a time when the global attention is focused on saving and protecting lives in a pandemic, the pursuit of the death penalty is all the more abhorrent.""Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: ""It's shocking the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to confront his accusers.""Singapore officials are not the first to issue a death penalty over a video conference call.

Man makes money buying his own pizza on DoorDash app,"The owner of a pizza restaurant in the US has discovered the DoorDash delivery app has been selling his food cheaper than he does - while still paying him full price for orders.A pizza for which he charged $24 (£20) was being advertised for $16 on DoorDash - and when he secretly ordered it himself, the app paid his restaurant the full $24 while charging him $16.He had not asked to be put on the app.He later found out it was part of a trial to gauge customer demand.Content strategist Ranjan Roy blogged about the anonymous restaurateur, who is his friend.Mr Roy said he first heard about the situation in March 2019, when his friend started receiving complaints about deliveries, even though his outlets did not deliver.At that point , he discovered he had been added to DoorDash - and noticed it was charging a lower price for one of his premium pizzas.So he ordered 10 pizzas, paid $160 and had them delivered to a friend's house. The restaurant was then paid $240 for the order by DoorDash.The next time, the restaurant prepared his friend's order by boxing up the pizza base without any toppings, maximising the ""profit"" from the mismatched prices.""I was genuinely curious if DoorDash would catch on - but they didn't,"" wrote Mr Roy.DoorDash did not respond to BBC News's request for comment.But Mr Roy said: ""We found out afterward that was all the result of a 'demand test' by DoorDash.""They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant's website and don't charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed on to the platform.""Third-party delivery platforms, as they've been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they've been subsidised into market dominance.""You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model.""DoorDash is backed by investment giant Softbank, which this week posted a record-breaking loss of nearly $13bn.

Funding the future during the pandemic,"Are you the owner of a fast-growing UK tech firm worried about keeping going during the current health crisis? Well you had better get your skates on - the Treasury is offering a £250m loan scheme for firms like yours and the money could be gone soon.When the idea of some kind of government help for the UK tech sector was floated in early April, it did not get a universally warm welcome. A letter from a dozen tech entrepreneurs to the Chancellor may not have helped - it was pointed out that several of them had received huge amounts of backing from overseas venture capital funds and did not appear to need support from the taxpayer.There were also warnings from some in the venture capital world that it was a bad idea for the government to try to pick winners in an area where many fledgling firms crash and burn even in the good times.But the Future Fund, launched this morning, appears to have dealt with the concerns of most of the critics. Fast-growing companies can apply for loans of between £125,000 and £5m, as long as they have investors willing to supply matching funds. ""We know that there has been a shock to the system, and we're hoping that we can help build some confidence,"" Treasury Minister Kemi Badenoch told me this morning.I put it to her that many of the early-stage firms in the tech and life sciences sectors were earning little or no revenue before the pandemic - so what had really changed? ""The crisis has affected their ability to access investment,"" she said. ""And we just want to unlock that investment for high-potential companies that will drive the future economy.""One company that has already applied to the fund told me that was exactly its situation - a short-term funding gap. Dave Ranyard's virtual reality gaming start-up Dream Reality Interactive is in one of the few sectors that is doing well at the moment. But the company still failed to raise quite as much money as it expected in March, from investors taking advantage of the government's existing Enterprise Investment Scheme: ""The markets were all shaky, people's net worth dropped because the stock market dropped. And so less of that  EIS money was placed.""Mr Ranyard says other schemes like the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans (CBILS) have not been suitable for tech firms, so they are giving the Future Fund a go. ""It's one of many things that we're trying, I think it could work well for us,"" he says. There appears to be little downside for the company, which has three years to pay back the loan - although the government could end up owning a chunk of the business: ""There are some things that come back to haunt you in three years,"" the entrepreneur says. ""But that's three years away - if we're still open then, I'll be happy.""The venture capitalist Robin Klein was among those who had been concerned that the government could end up trying to pick winners, but he is pleased with the way the scheme has turned out. The key, he says, is that companies need to have investors matching what the government puts in: ""They need committed, involved investors, and therefore having the government Invest alongside those types of investors will mean that we're finding the right companies.""The £250m going into the fund is a relatively modest amount -  the government's furlough scheme is costing  £14bn a month. If all the applicants wanted the full £5m, just fifty firms would be helped. Still, Kemi Badenoch says if demand proves high, then the Treasury will see what more can be done. Today has seen Rolls-Royce - for decades probably the UK's most important technology business - announce thousands of job losses. If those jobs are to be replaced, then fast-growing firms in sectors from video games to life sciences may need to be helped through these challenging times.",20 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community.

The shopping feature will also eventually appear on WhatsApp and the company's other messaging apps and integrate with live streams.For the average Facebook user, ""this will be a really seamless experience,"" Ms Amjadi said. ""You can go much deeper now without having to leave the app.""Once a buyer decides they want to spend money, they will usually be directed to the company's website to complete the transaction.And if problems arise or a buyer wants to ask questions, they can do so through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram Direct messages, some of which are already used by companies for that purpose.The rollout is part of a wider range of changes planned for shopping across Facebook's products, including:Anthony Ha, a senior writer at technology news site TechCrunch, said the pandemic lockdown may have worked in Facebook's favour.""After all, if your favourite store has changed their hours, or switched to online delivery or kerb-side pickup, they've almost certainly posted about it on Facebook or Instagram,"" he said.""So it makes sense for Facebook to make the purchase process as easy as possible from those profiles.""From a business perspective, the obvious goal is to drive more advertising. ""But it's also worth remembering that the pandemic's economic fallout will likely kill off many small business - including the ones that post and advertise on Facebook. ""So the company has a stake in helping those businesses survive in any way it can.""",19 May 2020,technology
EasyJet admits data of nine million hacked,"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers.It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"".The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach.EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January.It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April.""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC.""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed.""Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself.EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May.It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft.""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing.""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays.""In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating.""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary.""It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its advice on its website on how to spot such scams.Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google is blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day to Gmail users.It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said.""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data.""The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially.""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan.""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed.""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record. The British Airways breach in 2018 should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this.""British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details.The ICO later issued a record £183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach £3bn.Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers.Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant.Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals.The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card.Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task.Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions.Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.Are you an EasyJet customer? Have you been a victim of the cyber-attack?
