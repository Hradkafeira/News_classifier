'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.End of Youtube post  by royalcourttheatreTheatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis.""That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says.If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds.""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers.""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk.""The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says.""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest.""Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government.""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support.""Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June.In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector.""The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said.Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained.""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued.""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week.

Blue Peter: New presenter to be unveiled during lockdown,"Blue Peter usually introduces its new presenters doing something dramatic and daring, like jumping out of a plane.But on Thursday, its 39th presenter - Mwaka Mudenda - will be unveiled virtually from home due to the UK's lockdown restrictions.That doesn't mean she won't face a challenge though - she will be tasked with breaking a surprise world record.Mudenda, 25, who described landing her new role as ""mind-blowing"", won't find out what it is until her first show.""Despite lockdown, I've felt so welcomed by the incredible behind-the-scenes team that help run and deliver such a wonderful show - and I already feel like a big part of the Blue Peter family,"" Mudenda said.""I'm so excited to begin my adventure, with all the fun challenges it has in store. The chance to be a part of such a well-loved programme that has such an inspiring and creative young audience is a real blessing.""Mudenda - known as Mwaksy - will be joining fellow presenters Lindsey, Richie and Henry the dog.She was already working for the BBC in its sports department as an assistant producer in Salford when she was talent-spotted after appearing in some online sport videos.The Londoner moved to Manchester to study anthropology before landing a job at the BBC two years ago.Blue Peter editor Ellen Evans, says: ""It's going to be an extraordinary launch for Mwaksy in extraordinary times, she has had to do her first show - and her first Blue Peter presenter challenge - from her home, but I have been blown away by her positivity, her warmth, her humour and her willingness to give things a go so she'll fit perfectly with the Blue Peter family.""Mwaksy's debut can be seen on CBBC on Thursday at 17:30 BST.",13 May 2020,entertainment
'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.End of Youtube post  by royalcourttheatreTheatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis.""That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says.If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds.""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers.""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk.""The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says.""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest.""Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government.""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support.""Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June.In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector.""The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said.Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained.""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued.""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus.""",14 May 2020,entertainment

Music royalties reach a record high - but a storm is coming,"Musicians and songwriters in the UK received a record amount of money last year, but the loss of live music poses a major threat to income in 2020.The warning was issued by PRS for Music, the body that makes sure 145,000 songwriters, composers and publishers in the UK are paid when their music is played or performed around the world.The organisation collected a record £810m last year, a rise of 8.7%.But it said Covid-19 would result in an ""inevitable decline"" in 2020 and 2021.""Even though we had a record-breaking year, we know very well that we're in unprecedented, unpredictable times,"" chief executive Andrea Martin told the BBC.Revenues from ""live music and public performance will be hit"" not just in 2020 but in 2021, as international payments often take time to trickle down, she said.""There will be a downfall,"" she added. ""But by how much and by what per cent... your guess is just as good as mine.""PRS processed 18.8 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, and music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including like Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Old Town Road by Lil Nas X and Don't Call Me Up by Mabel.Live music generated £54m in royalties, up £15m since 2018. Revenues were boosted by major tours from the Spice Girls, Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the return of Glastonbury after a fallow year in 2018.But with an entire summer of festivals cancelled and dozens of major tours postponed until 2021, that figure will be impossible to recreate in next year's results.Last week, UK Music revealed the contribution of live music to the UK economy is set to drop in 2020 from an estimated £1.1bn to £200m, describing it as a ""catastrophic"" blow to the industry.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The lockdown also means songwriters will lose out on royalties gathered when their music is played in shops, cinemas, pubs, clubs and restaurants. In 2019, that figure was £168.2m.There is some good news, however. Royalties from music streaming rose 22.1% to £155m, while the money generated from music on video-on-demand services like Amazon and Netflix increased 47.5% to £17.7m.Early figures suggest more people have taken out streaming subscriptions during the lockdown, which may provide a small counterweight to the loss of live music.But many musicians have noted that the money they receive from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon is not enough to sustain a career.Tom Gray from indie band Gomez recently shared a chart, originally compiled by The Trichordist, showing how many streams artists require to make a living in the UK.On YouTube, a song would have to be played 7,267 times to generate £8.72 - or one hour of minimum wage. On Spotify, the figure was 3,114 streams, and on Apple Music 1,615 streams.Terrifying. The most up-to-date streaming rates adapted for £ and for UK minimum wage. Data from the excellent  @thetrichordist.  #BrokenRecord pic.twitter.com/XOoZ3IGisTEnd of Twitter post  by @MrTomGrayThat has led to a campaign, #BrokenRecord, seeking a more equitable system of distributing streaming money.Spearheaded by the Ivors Academy and the Musicians' Union, it is calling for a new system, where your subscription fee is distributed to the artists you actually listen to - rather than going into a central pot, where money is split between the most-streamed songs on a percentage basis.""This is what the consumer wants,"" said Graham Davies of the Ivors Academy, who is calling for a government-backed review.""They want their £9.99 a month to be paid to the artists, performers, songwriters and composers of the music they love.""In the meantime, the PRS Emergency Relief Fund has raised more than £2.1m to help members who have lost income as a result of Covid-19.

Leaf Arbuthnot: How rent-a-gran scheme sparked a debut novel,"By rights, freelance journalist Leaf Arbuthnot should have been pretty busy of late with preparations to launch her first novel. But, like for so many of us, normal life ground to a halt as the coronavirus swept in. That meant abandoning any ideas of a (cheap) white wine-fuelled press party or public readings from her novel Looking For Eliza, she says.""I feel like my life has been thrust into the deep freeze. It's sad to see all those things disappear. It's a bit depressing,"" she adds. Instead, holed up at her parents' house near Reading, rather than in her London flat, she's been trying distraction techniques to quash worries about how her book will fare and the future of her arts and culture freelance career.Baking has been high on the list, as has playing with the ""ridiculously fluffy"" Norbert - a chick from the family's chooks.But these things only go so far in a crisis, especially when the events she would normally cover have stalled and papers,  struggling even before the pandemic, are tentative about commissioning freelancers.  ""I'm frustrated by the way I'm dealing with this. I seem to be more paranoid. My friends tell me this is completely fine. This is a pandemic, your career isn't ending,"" says Leaf, who writes for the likes of the Guardian, the Spectator and the Sunday Times. ""I realise just how much of my work relied on the world happening with business as usual. But I know I'm lucky my book is coming out at all and without the internet I'd really be up the creek. ""Yet I feel like I need to touch base with reassurances again and again. I have low level neediness. That makes me dislike myself.""Her feelings will chime with those of a lot of people - and so will the themes of her book.Though unsurprisingly nothing to do with a pandemic, Looking For Eliza is about cross-generational loneliness - increasingly debated in recent years - and the value in forming human bonds outside your comfort zone.  Its protagonists are the widowed, disenchanted poet Ada in her 70s and the 25-year-old first-year Italian PhD Oxford student Eliza. Both are suffocated by loneliness, in its truest form. No efforts towards social interaction - be that fresher events and sex for Eliza, or hiring herself out as supportive ""rent-a-gran"" for Ada - can fill their individual emotional voids. And though they live across the road from each other, they could be worlds apart, like so many neighbours even without the barriers raised by a health crisis. And the generation gap doesn't help. But underneath they are two sides of one coin, having both become disconnected from a sense of self or place through the loss of a significant other.""I see Eliza as a young vine,"" says Leaf. ""She's recently disentangled herself from quite an abusive and intense relationship with her ex-girlfriend, Ruby, which started just as she was becoming an adult. ""She's grown up with that support, even if it was quite twisted. Now she's suddenly having to work out who she is by herself but lacks the tools to scoop her out of loneliness.""As for Ada, whose husband was a revered university professor, ""she's had a really wonderful marriage to a man who was generous and kind"", says Leaf. ""After his death, she realises the friends she thought were theirs collectively were more on his side of the ledger and suddenly all those relationships thin out and fracture. ""She finds she's living alone, not having had children because they couldn't, and she doesn't have the confidence or resources internally to be able to build a new life."" The two are brought together by Ada's Rent-A-Gran venture, through which she's realising just how widespread a problem social dislocation is. Their connection is instant. They bond through simple pleasures, such as cooking and lapsang souchong tea. And crucially, they are curious and non-judgemental about the generational differences in their world views. Ada is particularly interested to learn about Eliza's bisexuality. And, set against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, politics is thrown in (lightly) too. As the friendship grows stronger so does their self-worth. ""I really do think you can tool up against loneliness, you can pull up against it by finding connections close at home,"" says Leaf. ""There's been a real flowering of activity since lockdown, where people are really reinvesting in their local communities and just helping.""I've got friends who now know their neighbours' eating habits because they're doing their shopping. And yet they'd never spoken before and haven't physically met. I've been quite encouraged remotely.""On a community level I think we will enjoy the benefits of having engaged with people nearby and maybe a renewed understanding of how interconnected we all are.""In her own life, Leaf knows the value of reaching out to relationships outside your age bracket. She volunteers for Age UK, has separately made friends with two elderly people, and turns to her ""remarkable"" 100-year-old grandmother for advice. ""I feel I connect much better with two generations up,"" says Leaf. ""There's a real lack of judgment around these relationships and a mutual lack of understanding, which can be quite charming and lead to quite free conversations where you learn a lot about each other's point of view. Even if you don't agree, it doesn't matter.""In its review The Lady magazine said Leaf had been ""even-handed in pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of both women and reminds us how important it is to be with our elders"".While in the Evening Standard, Susannah Butter said of the book: ""There's a lot to identify with, whether you are in your seventies or a millennial.""End of Youtube post  by Link TVAnd as curious as it may sound, the seed of Rent-a-Gran grew from true events. A Google search will throw up agencies offering mainly the childcare services of an elderly lady. But Ada's experiences derive from articles Leaf read about Japan, where actors are hired short-term to fulfil familial roles.""You can rent a girlfriend and even children to take home with you to keep up appearances. I was really struck by that, because I felt that it was incredibly sad,"" says Leaf. ""We've got to a stage where people are so alienated from their families they can't be honest about the littleness of the life they're leading in the big city.""In other cultures, you can hire mourners or singers for funerals and other intimate ceremonies, she also found.Besides her relationships with older people, Leaf also injected other elements of her own life into her story but says: ""I didn't set out to write myself on the page.""She studied modern languages at Cambridge and remembers ""hoping it was going to be a great experience"". But, then not a drinker and being ""quite nerdy"", she felt isolated by the boozy socialising. ""I was both too mature and immature to flower in that context. Also, the horror at thinking, 'if this is going to be the time of my life, well good God, this is not sustainable, it's too disappointing,'"" she says. But like Eliza, she came to admire the Italian writer and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi. His presence looms in the background, ""hopefully to introduce readers to him,"" she says, as does Leaf's love of poetry - she's a judge for the Forward Poetry Prize and dabbles a bit herself.    And then there's a nod to wild swimming, which Leaf does all-year round, often in a mixed-age group. Sub-zero temperatures help her arthritis but she also reaps other rewards.""It's been really good for my mental health and there's a euphoria that sets in after three minutes in three degree water,"" she says. And she concludes: ""It's a good example of cross-generational connection.""",13 May 2020,entertainment
A Hero's Death? Fontaines DC confront the curse of the second album,"For the last 12 months, Fontaines DC have been on an unstoppable rise.Their debut album Dogrel, a vivid and raucous portrait of growing up in Dublin, landed on the Mercury Prize list; while all of its singles made the A-list at BBC 6 Music.By the end of 2019, they were celebrating several ""album of the year"" accolades with a sold-out UK tour, culminating in two triumphant homecoming shows at Dublin's Vicar Street.Not bad considering that, a year earlier, the band were still playing in pubs.The success ""never lost its ability to blow me away, but I tried not to let it,"" says frontman Grian Chatten.""We did our best to bury our heads in the sand and not take too much notice of any of the reviews - and luckily enough, we came out of the first album still ourselves.""That's why I can proudly say about our second album: It's written by the same [expletive] people.""End of Youtube post  by BBC MusicThat album was written and recorded with almost indecent haste - with sessions wrapping up in Los Angeles last October, just six months after Dogrel's release. The sun-soaked Californian vibes inevitably seeped into the recordings, and the quartet's scrappy riffs are newly decorated with surprising (but welcome) bursts of Laurel Canyon harmonies.""We really got into harmonising when we were doing these long drives across America,"" says Chatten. ""We'd always tried to figure out exactly what the Beach Boys were doing on their tunes. We wanted to be able to sing so we didn't need instruments. Then, wherever we were, we could have a few drinks in the pub and just go for it.""Practicing harmonies also turned out to be a lifeline for the five-piece, as life on the road took its toll. The band had to cancel several gigs last summer for unspecified ""health issues"", and Chatten now admits he'd accessed some ""dark places"" in his psyche as the tour progressed.""Our schedule was pretty badly-organised,"" he says, ""to the extent that we'd actually have hour-long sleeps rostered in.""If you're on your hundredth gig of the year and you haven't slept much, the worst thing you could possibly do for your own head is do a bad gig. ""So in order to feel some sort of connection, what I do is I often bring myself to places mentally when I'm playing a song that are actually quite toxic.""Sometimes it can be quite affecting because you find yourself in a very uncomfortable place, out of pure desperation for a connection with the song. ""But sometimes it overflows and it becomes a bit too much. I've definitely gone too far in what I've made myself think about on stage.""And that's where the harmonies came in. ""I think subconsciously we were reaching out to each other while we were practicing and writing little harmony parts in the back of the van,"" the singer says.""It's an amazing feeling. It gives you a great sense of community - maybe because the singing culture we would have seen growing up, the Dubliner-style pub singing, was so familiar.""You can hear the band's vocal prowess on their new single, A Hero's Death, where staccato ""bah bah bahs"" swirl dreamily around a slashing guitar riff.The song is simultaneously uplifting and sinister, as Chatten delivers some life advice (""tell your mother that you love her, and go out of your way for others"") before returning to the same, insistent phrase: ""Life ain't always empty"". It's unclear whether he's repeating the mantra as a statement of fact, or an attempt to convince himself of its truth.""I'm not sure myself,"" he confesses. ""I purposefully keep the things I write open to interpretation, even to myself."" Still, the fact that the chorus was inspired by the ""terrifying"" repetition of advertising slogans gives you a small clue about his intentions.The song was released last week, accompanied by a video starring Aiden Gillen - aka Game Of Thrones Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelis - playing a charismatic chat show host whose life spirals out of control when he finds himself overshadowed by his puppet side-kick.But his presence isn't the result of some marketing-driven record label spending spree, Chatten says.""I'd heard he was a fan. He'd come to see us once or twice, so we asked him to do it.""We didn't have much of a budget, but he just said we could buy him a pint.""End of Youtube post  by Fontaines DCThe video kicks off the build-up to their second album, due out in July, which is also called A Hero's Death.The title is a tongue-in-cheek way of acknowledging the ""difficult second album syndrome"" that's derailed countless bands over the years. ""I found the idea quite funny - because I'm half-expecting people to dislike [the album],"" says Chatten. ""So the idea of calling it A Hero's Death is kind of laughing about that and setting people up for disappointment.""In fact, the title track was inspired by Chatten's own anxiety over the record: He wrote the lyrics the very first time he listened to their debut, ""just to allay any fears of not being able to do it again"".The rest of the album came just as easily, leaving the band in the unusual-for-2020 position of having the sequel to a hit record ready in less than 12 months.""It's easier to write than not to write,"" says Chatten, matter-of-factly. ""There was no careerist element to it. We were under no pressure to release a second album.""If we'd said everything that we had to say in one album, then we wouldn't have bothered making a second.""Despite the quick turnaround, the band have evolved over the last year - and not just by adding harmonies.Because while Dogrel was a scabrous, if romantic, portrayal of Dublin - ""a pregnant city with a catholic mind"" - the follow-up has broader horizons, a decision borne of necessity, rather than choice. ""I would have liked to have more about Dublin,"" Chatten admits. ""I love living in Dublin and I think Dublin is an incredibly inspiring place - but I don't have the licence to write about it, because I haven't really been there for nearly two years now.""So I wrote about my own experiences, the things that happen in my imagination and vignettes of other people, with maybe more exacerbated situations than the ones I'm going through.""The album is destined for release in July, and the band had been expecting to debut the new songs at festivals around Europe.Of course, that's now on hold - but Chatten is philosophical about releasing the album during the lockdown.""It is kind of strange it coming out now, when there's not much face-to-face contact,"" he says. ""Last time, we were half-way through a tour when the album came out, and this time we're at home. ""It's kind of like being around for the second kid and not being there for the first.""A Hero's Death is due out on 31 July via Partisan Records.",10 May 2020,entertainment
'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.End of Youtube post  by royalcourttheatreTheatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis.""That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says.If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds.""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers.""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk.""The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says.""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest.""Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government.""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support.""Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June.In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector.""The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said.Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained.""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued.""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
Music royalties reach a record high - but a storm is coming,"Musicians and songwriters in the UK received a record amount of money last year, but the loss of live music poses a major threat to income in 2020.The warning was issued by PRS for Music, the body that makes sure 145,000 songwriters, composers and publishers in the UK are paid when their music is played or performed around the world.The organisation collected a record £810m last year, a rise of 8.7%.But it said Covid-19 would result in an ""inevitable decline"" in 2020 and 2021.""Even though we had a record-breaking year, we know very well that we're in unprecedented, unpredictable times,"" chief executive Andrea Martin told the BBC.Revenues from ""live music and public performance will be hit"" not just in 2020 but in 2021, as international payments often take time to trickle down, she said.""There will be a downfall,"" she added. ""But by how much and by what per cent... your guess is just as good as mine.""PRS processed 18.8 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, and music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including like Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Old Town Road by Lil Nas X and Don't Call Me Up by Mabel.Live music generated £54m in royalties, up £15m since 2018. Revenues were boosted by major tours from the Spice Girls, Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the return of Glastonbury after a fallow year in 2018.But with an entire summer of festivals cancelled and dozens of major tours postponed until 2021, that figure will be impossible to recreate in next year's results.Last week, UK Music revealed the contribution of live music to the UK economy is set to drop in 2020 from an estimated £1.1bn to £200m, describing it as a ""catastrophic"" blow to the industry.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The lockdown also means songwriters will lose out on royalties gathered when their music is played in shops, cinemas, pubs, clubs and restaurants. In 2019, that figure was £168.2m.There is some good news, however. Royalties from music streaming rose 22.1% to £155m, while the money generated from music on video-on-demand services like Amazon and Netflix increased 47.5% to £17.7m.Early figures suggest more people have taken out streaming subscriptions during the lockdown, which may provide a small counterweight to the loss of live music.But many musicians have noted that the money they receive from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon is not enough to sustain a career.Tom Gray from indie band Gomez recently shared a chart, originally compiled by The Trichordist, showing how many streams artists require to make a living in the UK.On YouTube, a song would have to be played 7,267 times to generate £8.72 - or one hour of minimum wage. On Spotify, the figure was 3,114 streams, and on Apple Music 1,615 streams.Terrifying. The most up-to-date streaming rates adapted for £ and for UK minimum wage. Data from the excellent  @thetrichordist.  #BrokenRecord pic.twitter.com/XOoZ3IGisTEnd of Twitter post  by @MrTomGrayThat has led to a campaign, #BrokenRecord, seeking a more equitable system of distributing streaming money.Spearheaded by the Ivors Academy and the Musicians' Union, it is calling for a new system, where your subscription fee is distributed to the artists you actually listen to - rather than going into a central pot, where money is split between the most-streamed songs on a percentage basis.""This is what the consumer wants,"" said Graham Davies of the Ivors Academy, who is calling for a government-backed review.""They want their £9.99 a month to be paid to the artists, performers, songwriters and composers of the music they love.""In the meantime, the PRS Emergency Relief Fund has raised more than £2.1m to help members who have lost income as a result of Covid-19. Martin says 1,600 songwriters have applied for assistance in the last week alone.Another £5m fund, set up by the charity Help Musicians, ran out of cash within a week after being launched in March.Trade body UK Music has subsequently called on the government to set up a new taskforce to revive the music industry as it navigates the pandemic.",14 May 2020,entertainment
