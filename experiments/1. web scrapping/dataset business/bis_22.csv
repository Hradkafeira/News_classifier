Fears of second coronavirus outbreak hit global shares,"Global stock markets have fallen amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases could cause more economic damage.The declines came after the US Federal Reserve warned that the American economy faces a long road to recovery.In the US on Thursday, the three main share indexes saw their worst day in weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7%.Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China. The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March.Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit.Earlier on Thursday, European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100, the Dax in Germany and France's CAC 40 all losing 4% or more.""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale. ""But the problem is there is a limit to governments injecting money.""Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus.Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs.But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said.US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise.Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days.""It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,"" he said.

Coronavirus: What is a recession?,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases.But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls.A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers.When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse.Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls.This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK.In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts.The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer.It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis.However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend.Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well.In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. At its worst, GDP fell 2.1% in a single quarter.Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services.This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity.There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be.If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back.So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come.A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery.But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend.But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further.Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come. ",12 June 2020,business
Fed warns US faces 'long road' to recovery,"The head of America's central bank has pledged to continue support for the US economy for ""as long as it takes"".Warning that the US faces a ""long road"" to recovery, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.A policymaker forecast released by the Fed showed rates remaining low until the end of 2022.""This is going to take some time,"" Mr Powell said.In December, Fed policymakers said they expected the US economy to grow about 2% this year and the unemployment rate to remain around 3.5%.But the pandemic has dramatically rewritten that outlook, prompting the loss of more than 20 million jobs in March and April in the US alone.The OECD on Wednesday said the pandemic had triggered the most severe recession in a century and warned that the global economy could contract 7.6% this year, should a second outbreak hit.Predictions released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect the US economy to shrink 6.5% this year and the unemployment rate to be 9.3%, before falling to 6.5% in 2021.That would still be a big increase from the 3.5% rate recorded in February.The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates toward zero at the onset of the pandemic and has pledged to maintain low rates until the economy is back on track.It has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system, buying up US Treasuries and other assets to encourage banks to keep lending and prevent a market collapse.It has also stepped in with new programmes to lend to small and medium-sized firms and buy corporate and municipal debt.The swift action has won widespread praise in Washington. In a hearing about the pandemic response on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called Mr Powell a ""rock star"".Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said the Fed's statement on Wednesday was ""affirmation of central banks everywhere doing what they need to do"".Analysts credit the Fed's aggressive response with helping to drive a rally in financial markets, which have rebounded sharply from their lows.Mr Powell on Wednesday said financial conditions had improved, thanks to the Fed's efforts to keep markets from freezing up.He defended the bank's plan to continue asset purchases at the current levels, despite criticisms that such moves primarily help wealthy investors.""We don't take those gains for granted,"" Mr Powell said.No change in interest rates at this meeting, and it seems most of the Fed's policy makers expect no change before 2023.One of the documents released alongside the policy statements is a summary of the expectations of the Fed's policy makers.It doesn't identify individuals, but it does give us some indication of what they're thinking, if not exactly who is thinking it.None expect rates to rise this year or next. There is at least one who thinks there will be a rise of a full percentage point in 2022. But the majority think that won't happen.On growth the most optimistic thinks this year will see a contraction of 4.2%. One expects a pretty hideous figure of 10%.Most expect a return to growth next year. But if you take the median - the one in the middle if you rank them - it will be 2022 before this year's losses are fully recovered.The cumulative picture for that projection is an economy 1.6% larger in that year than it was last year.That suggests, for that period, more than two years of lost growth, at the rate they think is likely over the long term.",10 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: UK economy could be among worst hit of leading nations, says OECD","The UK is likely to be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.If there were a second peak in the pandemic, the UK economy could contract by as much as 14%.""The crisis will cast a long shadow over the world,"" the OECD added.It said that in what it called a ""single-hit scenario"", with no second peak, there could be contractions of 11.4% in France, 11.1% in Spain, 11.3% in Italy and 6.6% in Germany.In its latest assessment, the OECD found that the UK's largely service-based economy meant that it had been particularly badly hit by the government's lockdown restrictions.The services sector, including financial services, hospitality and tourism, makes up about three-quarters of the UK's GDP.In response to the think tank's report, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only one to suffer: ""In common with many other economies around the world, we're seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy.""The unprecedented action we've taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible.""Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Today's evidence from the OECD is deeply worrying, showing the UK was particularly exposed when the coronavirus crisis hit.""The government's failure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown are making the economic impact of this crisis worse."" The central finding of the OECD forecasts is that the expectations or hopes of a rapid bounceback in the economy - a so-called V-shaped chart - is not now happening.As Secretary General Angel Gurria put it to me, it will be ""U-shaped"", the question is how long will be the period at the bottom of this ""U"".This pattern is not affecting all countries equally.And in the event of there being no further peak, the prediction is that the UK is the worst hit this year, though just a little bit worse than Italy and France.For those who like a glass half full, it also predicts the strongest growth in the UK at 9% for 2021. But that is a rather hollow prize.The reason why is that the UK economy is peculiarly exposed as a trading economy with significant service and tourist sectors.But it is also a nation that has been among the hardest hit by the underlying pandemic.This hit comes despite a much-praised rapid response deploying tens of billions to keep millions of workers on payrolls.The OECD also mentions the pandemic economic impact being ""compounded"" by the looming plausible failure to sign a trade deal with the EU and new trade barriers with the European Union at the end of the year.It recommends temporarily extending the UK's stay in the single market. That is advice that the government has shown no inclination to follow so far.The bigger point is that the OECD is subtly pointing to the fact that one rescue package is not enough.Late last week the Germans announced a massive 4% stimulus to the economy, including a thumping cut to VAT, and significant subsidies for the purchase of cars.The league table is an invitation to do more. And we will soon enough get actual hard economic data, as opposed to forecasts such as this, when the monthly GDP figure for April - entirely locked down - is published on Friday.The OECD said the pandemic had started to recede in many countries and activity had begun to pick up, but it does not expect a convincing recovery. It sees the outlook for public health as extremely uncertain.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said the pandemic would have ""dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments"".She added: ""Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery. Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.""The OECD looked at two scenarios for how the pandemic might unfold, depending on whether there is a second wave of contagion or not before the end of this year.If that does happen, two countries - France and Spain - would suffer even deeper declines in economic activity than the UK this year.The report describes both outlooks as sobering, but either way, the deep recession now unfolding will be followed by a slow recovery.  In the more severe case, the global economy could shrink by 7.6% over this year, the OECD says.That figure is significantly worse than predictions put forward by other agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have warned about the high level of uncertainty attached to their forecasts.By the end of 2021, the report says that five or more years of income growth could be lost in many countries. It says the impact on livelihoods will be especially severe among the most vulnerable groups.   The OECD also says the pandemic has accelerated the shift from what it calls ""great integration"" to ""great fragmentation"". That is essentially a setback for globalisation, reflected in additional trade and investment restrictions and many borders that are closed at least while the health crisis persists.

Fed warns US faces 'long road' to recovery,"The head of America's central bank has pledged to continue support for the US economy for ""as long as it takes"".Warning that the US faces a ""long road"" to recovery, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.A policymaker forecast released by the Fed showed rates remaining low until the end of 2022.""This is going to take some time,"" Mr Powell said.In December, Fed policymakers said they expected the US economy to grow about 2% this year and the unemployment rate to remain around 3.5%.But the pandemic has dramatically rewritten that outlook, prompting the loss of more than 20 million jobs in March and April in the US alone.The OECD on Wednesday said the pandemic had triggered the most severe recession in a century and warned that the global economy could contract 7.6% this year, should a second outbreak hit.Predictions released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect the US economy to shrink 6.5% this year and the unemployment rate to be 9.3%, before falling to 6.5% in 2021.That would still be a big increase from the 3.5% rate recorded in February.The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates toward zero at the onset of the pandemic and has pledged to maintain low rates until the economy is back on track.It has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system, buying up US Treasuries and other assets to encourage banks to keep lending and prevent a market collapse.It has also stepped in with new programmes to lend to small and medium-sized firms and buy corporate and municipal debt.The swift action has won widespread praise in Washington. In a hearing about the pandemic response on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called Mr Powell a ""rock star"".Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said the Fed's statement on Wednesday was ""affirmation of central banks everywhere doing what they need to do"".Analysts credit the Fed's aggressive response with helping to drive a rally in financial markets, which have rebounded sharply from their lows.Mr Powell on Wednesday said financial conditions had improved, thanks to the Fed's efforts to keep markets from freezing up.He defended the bank's plan to continue asset purchases at the current levels, despite criticisms that such moves primarily help wealthy investors.""We don't take those gains for granted,"" Mr Powell said.No change in interest rates at this meeting, and it seems most of the Fed's policy makers expect no change before 2023.One of the documents released alongside the policy statements is a summary of the expectations of the Fed's policy makers.It doesn't identify individuals, but it does give us some indication of what they're thinking, if not exactly who is thinking it.None expect rates to rise this year or next. There is at least one who thinks there will be a rise of a full percentage point in 2022. But the majority think that won't happen.On growth the most optimistic thinks this year will see a contraction of 4.2%. One expects a pretty hideous figure of 10%.Most expect a return to growth next year. But if you take the median - the one in the middle if you rank them - it will be 2022 before this year's losses are fully recovered.The cumulative picture for that projection is an economy 1.6% larger in that year than it was last year.That suggests, for that period, more than two years of lost growth, at the rate they think is likely over the long term.",10 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: UK economy could be among worst hit of leading nations, says OECD","The UK is likely to be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.If there were a second peak in the pandemic, the UK economy could contract by as much as 14%.""The crisis will cast a long shadow over the world,"" the OECD added.It said that in what it called a ""single-hit scenario"", with no second peak, there could be contractions of 11.4% in France, 11.1% in Spain, 11.3% in Italy and 6.6% in Germany.In its latest assessment, the OECD found that the UK's largely service-based economy meant that it had been particularly badly hit by the government's lockdown restrictions.The services sector, including financial services, hospitality and tourism, makes up about three-quarters of the UK's GDP.In response to the think tank's report, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only one to suffer: ""In common with many other economies around the world, we're seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy.""The unprecedented action we've taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible.""Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Today's evidence from the OECD is deeply worrying, showing the UK was particularly exposed when the coronavirus crisis hit.""The government's failure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown are making the economic impact of this crisis worse."" The central finding of the OECD forecasts is that the expectations or hopes of a rapid bounceback in the economy - a so-called V-shaped chart - is not now happening.As Secretary General Angel Gurria put it to me, it will be ""U-shaped"", the question is how long will be the period at the bottom of this ""U"".This pattern is not affecting all countries equally.And in the event of there being no further peak, the prediction is that the UK is the worst hit this year, though just a little bit worse than Italy and France.For those who like a glass half full, it also predicts the strongest growth in the UK at 9% for 2021. But that is a rather hollow prize.The reason why is that the UK economy is peculiarly exposed as a trading economy with significant service and tourist sectors.But it is also a nation that has been among the hardest hit by the underlying pandemic.This hit comes despite a much-praised rapid response deploying tens of billions to keep millions of workers on payrolls.The OECD also mentions the pandemic economic impact being ""compounded"" by the looming plausible failure to sign a trade deal with the EU and new trade barriers with the European Union at the end of the year.It recommends temporarily extending the UK's stay in the single market. That is advice that the government has shown no inclination to follow so far.The bigger point is that the OECD is subtly pointing to the fact that one rescue package is not enough.Late last week the Germans announced a massive 4% stimulus to the economy, including a thumping cut to VAT, and significant subsidies for the purchase of cars.The league table is an invitation to do more. And we will soon enough get actual hard economic data, as opposed to forecasts such as this, when the monthly GDP figure for April - entirely locked down - is published on Friday.The OECD said the pandemic had started to recede in many countries and activity had begun to pick up, but it does not expect a convincing recovery. It sees the outlook for public health as extremely uncertain.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said the pandemic would have ""dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments"".She added: ""Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery. Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.""The OECD looked at two scenarios for how the pandemic might unfold, depending on whether there is a second wave of contagion or not before the end of this year.If that does happen, two countries - France and Spain - would suffer even deeper declines in economic activity than the UK this year.The report describes both outlooks as sobering, but either way, the deep recession now unfolding will be followed by a slow recovery.  In the more severe case, the global economy could shrink by 7.6% over this year, the OECD says.That figure is significantly worse than predictions put forward by other agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have warned about the high level of uncertainty attached to their forecasts.By the end of 2021, the report says that five or more years of income growth could be lost in many countries. It says the impact on livelihoods will be especially severe among the most vulnerable groups.   The OECD also says the pandemic has accelerated the shift from what it calls ""great integration"" to ""great fragmentation"". That is essentially a setback for globalisation, reflected in additional trade and investment restrictions and many borders that are closed at least while the health crisis persists.

"Coronavirus: Twitter removes more than 170,000 pro-China accounts","Twitter has removed more than 170,000 accounts it says were tied to an operation to spread pro-China messages.Some of those posts were about the coronavirus outbreak, the social media platform has announced.The company said ""a core network"" of 23,750 highly active accounts had been deleted, along with another 150,000 ""amplifier accounts"".Twitter also revealed it has shut down more than a thousand Russia-based misinformation accounts.The firm said the Chinese network, which was based in the People's Republic of China (PRC), had links to an earlier state-backed operation it broke up alongside Facebook and YouTube last year.That operation had been pushing out messages about the political situation in Hong Kong.""While this network is new, the technical links we used to identify the activity and attribute it to the PRC remain consistent with activity we initially identified and disclosed in August 2019,"" Twitter said in its company blog, which was also tweeted by the firm's founder Jack Dorsey.The US-based messaging platform added that it had been ""thoroughly studying and investigating past coordinated information operations from the PRC.""While the 23,750 accounts were the main focus, 150,000 accounts were identified as helping to boost the messages online.Twitter said the two interconnected sets of accounts were caught early and typically had very few followers with low levels of engagement.""In general, this entire network was involved in a range of manipulative and coordinated activities. They were tweeting predominantly in Chinese languages and spreading geopolitical narratives favourable to the Communist Party of China (CCP), while continuing to push deceptive narratives about the political dynamics in Hong Kong,"" the blog said.Twitter also said it had discovered a network of accounts linked to a media website it found to be ""engaging in state-backed political propaganda within Russia"". This network of accounts, totalling 1,152, has now been suspended. ""Activities included promoting the United Russia party and attacking political dissidents,"" Twitter's blog added.Last week, Twitter accused US President Donald Trump of making false claims in some of his posts, although the platform has come under fire for not removing coronavirus misinformation.Earlier this week, the company said it was trialling a new ""read before you retweet"" pop-up aimed to promote ""informed discussion"".The message will appear on articles that users share that they haven't yet opened on the site.Mr Dorsey, Twitter's high-profile chief executive, has also been making headlines recently by pledging money to anti-coronavirus efforts and racial equality organisations.",12 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: What is a recession?,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases.But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls.A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers.When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse.Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls.This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK.In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts.The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer.It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis.However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend.Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well.In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. At its worst, GDP fell 2.1% in a single quarter.Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services.This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity.There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be.If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back.So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come.A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery.But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend.But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further.Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens.

George Floyd: Microsoft bars facial recognition sales to police,"Microsoft has become the latest US company to limit the use of its facial recognition technology by police.The firm said it would not start sales to US police departments until the country approves national regulation of the technology, which critics say is racially biased and easy to abuse.Amazon and IBM have already made similar moves.These followed widespread protests over police brutality and racial discrimination.Amazon on Wednesday banned police from using its tech for one year, while IBM earlier said it would stop offering the technology for ""mass surveillance or racial profiling"".The American Civil Liberties Union has campaigned against such software for years, warning there is a danger it will be used to for widespread ""suspicionless"" surveillance.""Microsoft, Amazon and IBM have finally started to take action. But we still have a long way to go to forever end the over-policing and surveillance of black and brown communities,""  the organisation said in a statement.It called on US lawmakers to order an immediate ""pause"" on law enforcement use of the technology.Firms have been under pressure in recent weeks to respond to the protests triggered by George Floyd's death in police custody.Microsoft president Brad Smith said at an event that the firm had not sold to police departments and would not start ""until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology"".Microsoft first called for national regulation more than two years ago, warning that inaction could lead such services to ""spread in ways that exacerbate societal issues"". Companies tend to favour national rules, rather than be forced to deal with a patchwork of local laws.However, there are some concerns that a national law could be a way to override stricter local regulation.San Francisco, for example, has already banned facial recognition technology by its police and public agencies.",11 June 2020,business
Fears of second coronavirus outbreak hit global shares,"Global stock markets have fallen amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases could cause more economic damage.The declines came after the US Federal Reserve warned that the American economy faces a long road to recovery.In the US on Thursday, the three main share indexes saw their worst day in weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 7%.Stock markets in Asia also fell on Friday with benchmark indexes losing ground in Japan, Hong Kong and China. The falls followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March.Energy and travel stocks were among the biggest losers, as global crude oil prices also took a hit.Earlier on Thursday, European shares also dropped, with the UK's FTSE 100, the Dax in Germany and France's CAC 40 all losing 4% or more.""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for a second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at Societe Generale. ""But the problem is there is a limit to governments injecting money.""Share prices had gained in recent weeks amid hopes that the economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus.Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to new highs.But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said.US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, At a news conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell warned that this assessment may prove optimistic, if coronavirus infection and hospitalisation rates rise.Several states that have moved to reopen, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days.""It could hurt the recovery, even if you don't have a national level pandemic. Just a series of local ones, of local spikes, could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in travelling, in restaurants and in entertainment,"" he said.

At its worst, GDP fell 2.1% in a single quarter.Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services.This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity.There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be.If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back.So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come.A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery.But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend.But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further.Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come. ",12 June 2020,business
Fed warns US faces 'long road' to recovery,"The head of America's central bank has pledged to continue support for the US economy for ""as long as it takes"".Warning that the US faces a ""long road"" to recovery, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.A policymaker forecast released by the Fed showed rates remaining low until the end of 2022.""This is going to take some time,"" Mr Powell said.In December, Fed policymakers said they expected the US economy to grow about 2% this year and the unemployment rate to remain around 3.5%.But the pandemic has dramatically rewritten that outlook, prompting the loss of more than 20 million jobs in March and April in the US alone.The OECD on Wednesday said the pandemic had triggered the most severe recession in a century and warned that the global economy could contract 7.6% this year, should a second outbreak hit.Predictions released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect the US economy to shrink 6.5% this year and the unemployment rate to be 9.3%, before falling to 6.5% in 2021.That would still be a big increase from the 3.5% rate recorded in February.The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates toward zero at the onset of the pandemic and has pledged to maintain low rates until the economy is back on track.It has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system, buying up US Treasuries and other assets to encourage banks to keep lending and prevent a market collapse.It has also stepped in with new programmes to lend to small and medium-sized firms and buy corporate and municipal debt.The swift action has won widespread praise in Washington. In a hearing about the pandemic response on Wednesday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called Mr Powell a ""rock star"".Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said the Fed's statement on Wednesday was ""affirmation of central banks everywhere doing what they need to do"".Analysts credit the Fed's aggressive response with helping to drive a rally in financial markets, which have rebounded sharply from their lows.Mr Powell on Wednesday said financial conditions had improved, thanks to the Fed's efforts to keep markets from freezing up.He defended the bank's plan to continue asset purchases at the current levels, despite criticisms that such moves primarily help wealthy investors.""We don't take those gains for granted,"" Mr Powell said.No change in interest rates at this meeting, and it seems most of the Fed's policy makers expect no change before 2023.One of the documents released alongside the policy statements is a summary of the expectations of the Fed's policy makers.It doesn't identify individuals, but it does give us some indication of what they're thinking, if not exactly who is thinking it.None expect rates to rise this year or next. There is at least one who thinks there will be a rise of a full percentage point in 2022. But the majority think that won't happen.On growth the most optimistic thinks this year will see a contraction of 4.2%. One expects a pretty hideous figure of 10%.Most expect a return to growth next year. But if you take the median - the one in the middle if you rank them - it will be 2022 before this year's losses are fully recovered.The cumulative picture for that projection is an economy 1.6% larger in that year than it was last year.That suggests, for that period, more than two years of lost growth, at the rate they think is likely over the long term.",10 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: UK economy could be among worst hit of leading nations, says OECD","The UK is likely to be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.Britain's economy is likely to slump by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.If there were a second peak in the pandemic, the UK economy could contract by as much as 14%.""The crisis will cast a long shadow over the world,"" the OECD added.It said that in what it called a ""single-hit scenario"", with no second peak, there could be contractions of 11.4% in France, 11.1% in Spain, 11.3% in Italy and 6.6% in Germany.In its latest assessment, the OECD found that the UK's largely service-based economy meant that it had been particularly badly hit by the government's lockdown restrictions.The services sector, including financial services, hospitality and tourism, makes up about three-quarters of the UK's GDP.In response to the think tank's report, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only one to suffer: ""In common with many other economies around the world, we're seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy.""The unprecedented action we've taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible.""Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Today's evidence from the OECD is deeply worrying, showing the UK was particularly exposed when the coronavirus crisis hit.""The government's failure to get on top of the health crisis, delay going into lockdown and chaotic mismanagement of the exit from lockdown are making the economic impact of this crisis worse."" The central finding of the OECD forecasts is that the expectations or hopes of a rapid bounceback in the economy - a so-called V-shaped chart - is not now happening.As Secretary General Angel Gurria put it to me, it will be ""U-shaped"", the question is how long will be the period at the bottom of this ""U"".This pattern is not affecting all countries equally.And in the event of there being no further peak, the prediction is that the UK is the worst hit this year, though just a little bit worse than Italy and France.For those who like a glass half full, it also predicts the strongest growth in the UK at 9% for 2021. But that is a rather hollow prize.The reason why is that the UK economy is peculiarly exposed as a trading economy with significant service and tourist sectors.But it is also a nation that has been among the hardest hit by the underlying pandemic.This hit comes despite a much-praised rapid response deploying tens of billions to keep millions of workers on payrolls.The OECD also mentions the pandemic economic impact being ""compounded"" by the looming plausible failure to sign a trade deal with the EU and new trade barriers with the European Union at the end of the year.It recommends temporarily extending the UK's stay in the single market. That is advice that the government has shown no inclination to follow so far.The bigger point is that the OECD is subtly pointing to the fact that one rescue package is not enough.Late last week the Germans announced a massive 4% stimulus to the economy, including a thumping cut to VAT, and significant subsidies for the purchase of cars.The league table is an invitation to do more. And we will soon enough get actual hard economic data, as opposed to forecasts such as this, when the monthly GDP figure for April - entirely locked down - is published on Friday.The OECD said the pandemic had started to recede in many countries and activity had begun to pick up, but it does not expect a convincing recovery. It sees the outlook for public health as extremely uncertain.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said the pandemic would have ""dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments"".She added: ""Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery. Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.""The OECD looked at two scenarios for how the pandemic might unfold, depending on whether there is a second wave of contagion or not before the end of this year.If that does happen, two countries - France and Spain - would suffer even deeper declines in economic activity than the UK this year.The report describes both outlooks as sobering, but either way, the deep recession now unfolding will be followed by a slow recovery.  In the more severe case, the global economy could shrink by 7.6% over this year, the OECD says.That figure is significantly worse than predictions put forward by other agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have warned about the high level of uncertainty attached to their forecasts.By the end of 2021, the report says that five or more years of income growth could be lost in many countries. It says the impact on livelihoods will be especially severe among the most vulnerable groups.   The OECD also says the pandemic has accelerated the shift from what it calls ""great integration"" to ""great fragmentation"". That is essentially a setback for globalisation, reflected in additional trade and investment restrictions and many borders that are closed at least while the health crisis persists.

Coronavirus: What is a recession?,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases.But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls.A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers.When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse.Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls.This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK.In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts.The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer.It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis.However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend.Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well.In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards.

"German airline Lufthansa plans to cut 22,000 jobs","German airline Lufthansa has said it will cut 22,000 jobs as it struggles to deal with the slump in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The carrier predicted a slow recovery in demand and expected to have about 100 fewer aircraft after the crisis.

Ben & Jerry's maker Unilever settles on UK base,"Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, is to combine its two businesses into one structure in the UK.It comes after the firm tried to combine into a Dutch company in 2018.That plan, which some suggested was linked to Brexit, was abandoned after UK shareholders objected.Unilever said no jobs would be lost in the latest move, and its existing headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands would stay where they were.""It's a big departure from the failed plans of 2018, when the group sought a single listing in Amsterdam,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown.""Unilever's sales have been lacklustre of late, and the pursuit of a single listing is Unilever's way of making sure it's in the best possible shape to start the difficult process of rejuvenation."" However, she added that the ""big question""  was whether shareholders in the Netherlands would try to block the plans, as their British counterparts did in 2018. Currently the two firms' shares are listed independently in London and Amsterdam, with slightly more of the value of the joint enterprise held in the Netherlands.This led to the original proposal of making it a Dutch firm, which some speculated was linked to Brexit - claims the firm denied.The news came as some banks said they planned to move assets and personnel out of London ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union as they feared losing access to EU markets.Later in 2018, when it became clear that Unilever would lose its place in the index of Britain's top 100 companies, the FTSE 100, UK shareholders objected and the deal faltered.The new structure will make it a legally simpler business under Unilever PLC. The board will meet in London, whereas before it would alternate between its two homes.The company's unusual current structure comes from the merger 90 years ago of soap maker Lever Brothers and Dutch spreads maker Margarine Unie. The firms became Unilever PLC and Unilever NV.Reports of the death of the City of London as the centre of European finance appear to have been greatly exaggerated. Unilever's decision to end its unusual two-country corporate structure after 90 years is, at its heart, a triumph of money (the City) over politics (Brexit). Unilever has been under pressure from shareholders to simplify its structure for more than a decade. Many investors have thought the complexity cost money, made it difficult to shed poorly performing divisions, or made the company unattractive to potential suitors. Two years ago, in the wake of a takeover approach from America's Kraft Heinz, Unilever decided it would bow to pressure. It would move its corporate headquarters to Rotterdam - the only problem being that the move would mean it would have to be removed from the FTSE 100 index of the largest companies listed in London. Shareholders were far from happy, and quickly put a stop to the move.Unilever has since continued with the simplification plan, and has arrived at a predictable conclusion. The Dutch arm will be subsumed into the UK entity, and the new parent company will be Unilever PLC. It remains to be seen whether the government of Netherlands will try and overturn the decision. For the moment, however, the power of the City has prevailed.",11 June 2020,business
British Airways to sell art collection to raise cash,"British Airways is selling some of its multi-million-pound art collection to raise cash to help it through the coronavirus pandemic.The collection includes art by Damien Hirst, Bridget Riley and Peter Doig, with one work believed to have been valued at more than £1m.It is understood at least 10 pieces have been identified for sale, although exactly which ones is unclear.BA has seen a collapse in air travel and is set to cut thousands of jobs.Last week, BA boss Alex Cruz warned that the cash-strapped airline's survival was at stake unless there was a drastic restructuring of the business.London's Evening Standard newspaper, which first reported news of the art sell-off, said auction house Sotheby's had been brought in to arrange sales as soon as possible.Other works in BA's collection are pieces by Tracey Emin, Anish Kapoor and Chris Ofili. The airline would not comment on the sale, nor identify which works would go under the hammer.However, the most valuable piece is believed to be by Bridget Riley and worth, according to one source, ""at least seven figures"". It was bought many years ago and has risen substantially in value.Much of the collection was amassed with the help of London-based curators Artwise, which worked with BA for 17 years until 2012 and bought more than 1,500 works for the airline.Founders Susie Allen and Laura Culpan said in a statement to the BBC: ""Generally we purchased and commissioned works by artists early in their careers, so during this time many of the works have grown in value - although this was never the intention behind the collection.""It established BA as one of the big corporate supporters of contemporary art. The works would rotate around BA offices globally, they said.""We are of course very sad to see some of the key treasures from the BA art collection being put up for auction - a collection which, in its day, was so admired and was the first of its kind within the airline industry. However, we do understand that these are unprecedented times,"" Artwise said.Like most airlines, BA's finances have been hit by the grounding of aircraft due to the virus lockdown. The airline proposes to make 12,000 staff redundant, with more than 1,000 pilot roles at risk.

Coronavirus: Young hit hardest by lockdown financial squeeze,"Young people have been hardest hit by a fall in their income during lockdown as more of their money goes on essentials, official data suggests.The youngest and oldest workers are most likely to have lost their jobs or seen income cut owing to the system of state-paid wages.With little in savings and less chance to cut spending, the under-30s would be hit hardest by this, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Renters have found it just as tough.The ONS has calculated, for the first time, the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on household spending.It found that a typical household in the UK normally spent an average of £182 a week on activities, such as travel, holidays and meals out, that have been mostly ruled out under health guidance during the virus outbreak. This is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of £831.Many households have been saving that money instead or using it to cover any loss of income.Thousands of people have lost their jobs and millions have received only 80% of their usual wages as they have been furloughed - in other words, told not to work while the government covers their pay.The latest figures show more than 7.5 million people had been furloughed in the UK by the end of May, while another 2.5 million self-employed workers have applied for grants to cover their losses.While many people have saved, there remains the need for about 53% of income to be spent on essentials, such as food, rent, or the mortgage.Some, but not all of this can be deferred, through so-called payment holidays, particularly credit card bills, gas and electricity charges or mortgage repayments.However, young people, renters and people living in London have found a greater proportion of their income goes on essentials, some of which cannot be deferred, than other groups.As a result, they are likely to be hit the hardest if their income drops and they need to find the money for costs such as food and housing.Jared Thomas, 26, from south Wales, has seen work dry up as the coronavirus outbreak means financially stretched customers have had little demand for his tree surgery services.""Everybody's life has been turned upside down,"" he says.""I really don't know when work will pick up. I'd be surprised if it does for the next month or two.""He has claimed the universal credit benefit for the first time, so he can pay the rent.The ONS said households renting their home from a landlord spent 61% of their usual weekly budget on essentials, compared with 52% for households which owned their home outright or with a mortgage.A typical 30-year-old spent 58% of their weekly budget on essentials and normally only 19% on what has been prevented during lockdown, such as drinks in a pub, the ONS said.On the other hand, older households of between 65 and 74 years old spent far less of their budget on essentials (43%) and considerably more (29%) on activities that have been unavailable.In London, where property prices and rental costs are most expensive, a typical household spent 58% of its weekly budget on essentials such as food and housing costs, the highest of any region or country of the UK.""For those who have faced an uphill battle during lockdown, it's a timely reminder of how much difference it can make to have something set aside for emergencies,"" said Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Nobody is pretending it is easy to put money aside when you're starting out in your adult life, but it is worth doing whatever you can afford, as soon as you can afford to do so.""Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at insurer Aviva, said: ""While it is true to say that during the coronavirus lockdown 'we are all in it together', the impact on our individual finances is not equal.""",11 June 2020,business
Coronavirus may have huge impact on property markets,"The saying ""there is no place like home"" is perhaps not so heart-warming a thought these days.After all, most of us have been locked down in our house or apartment for a very long time.The coronavirus pandemic will, however, do more than change the way we might feel about our homes. It has the potential to have a huge impact on property markets around the world. It is fairly clear that with massive unemployment, wage cuts, business failures, and job uncertainty, many people are likely to be cautious about making the biggest investment of their lives - buying a home.Normally that leads to falling house prices, and during the last recession and credit crunch that is what we saw in the UK, US and many other countries.In the UK, the Nationwide house price index for May showed that prices fell 1.7% from the previous month, the largest decline for 11 years.But as Robert Gardner, the Nationwide's chief economist, points out, ""there are some signs this is starting to stabilise"". He adds that this is because the current situation is not a typical economic downturn.Instead, the UK government - like others around the world - consciously decided to put much of the economy on hold. This was at the same time as putting in place a host of measures to support households and businesses, such as the worker furloughing scheme.The hope, therefore, is that as lockdown restrictions continue to be lifted, economies and housing markets will rebound. In the US, house prices are still rising. ""Many areas [of the country] have put a moratorium on evictions, normally for 60 to 90 days, but in some areas for six months,"" says Prof Nori Gerardo Lietz, who teaches real estate investment at Harvard Business School.This means that the immediate problems have been pushed on to landlords and the banks, which isn't to say that there won't be trouble further down the line. Especially as the US unemployment rate remains sky high since the coronavirus lockdown - 13.3% in May, albeit down from 14.7% in April.However, behind those headline figures, there are other forces at work on the property sector. Many of us have suddenly realised that we can work from home and avoid the commute and the office, and this is already having an influence on the market. Rightmove, the UK property website, has reported a significant rise in the number of people searching for homes further from town and city centres, with larger gardens and space for a home office. This may not be a permanent change, but coronavirus is certainly making many people think about how and where they work and live. For the commercial property sector, the changes are far more dramatic, especially on the UK's High Streets. ""Retail [in the UK] has had problems for ages,"" says Prof Michael White, an expert in real estate economics, at Nottingham Trent University. ""And at the moment incomes are obviously being hit by furloughs, and then there will be a squeeze on spending in a recession.""It means an acceleration of what we saw before the virus struck - many High Streets have been decaying for years. And now that many more of us have discovered how much we can buy online that is only going to increase in speed.An added issue is that before coronavirus, the trend was already towards fewer shops on the High Street, and more services - things you can't get online - such as cafes, hairdressers and beauticians. ""The twist is that these services have been hit, so we have seen a slowing down of a growing trend,"" says Prof Andrew Baum, who leads the Future of Real Estate Initiative at Oxford University's Said Business School.This means that High Streets have been hit twice as hard - many stores are shut and face-to-face service suppliers have almost totally closed. The result has been a rise in rent arrears. If this is just a matter of landlords missing or deferring one or two quarters of rents, that is not a massive problem for the industry.But if this is the start of a long-term trend then that will cause problems, and possibly a knock-on fall in the capital value of many retail properties, possibly by 20%-30% believes Prof Baum. In the US, where there has been a similar trend in the retail sector, the problem is slightly different. As land is so cheap, and planning permission so easy to get, there is a long tradition of retail parks and malls just being abandoned if they are not making money, or cost too much to upgrade. The impact of coronavirus could see this trend increase.""The problem with US retail is not that it's over built, but that it is under demolished,"" says Prof Gerardo Lietz.For providers of office space, if coronavirus turns out to be a one-off hit, with just two quarters of rents deferred, there is little reason for property values to be affected at all.But instead, coronavirus might actually have a massive influence on the sector. After all, if the housing market changes as people look for more suburban and rural properties where they can work from home, there will be less need for office space to work in.The office property market will therefore have to adapt, something Prof White believes the industry is very good at.As he explains, if you strip out inflation, ""average rents in London are the same as they were 100 years ago"". He says this shows that the office property market has been very good at matching supply and demand for a very long period of time.As the UK's capital needed more offices in the 1950s and 1960s, many of the townhouses of the West End were converted from residential to commercial use. Then the City of London was rebuilt in the 1980s, with skyscrapers appearing, and Canary Wharf was constructed in London's former docklands in the 1990s.Recently, as London has needed more accommodation, buildings including office blocks have been turned back into flats and apartments. Overall, the property market has two things going for it even in these rapidly changing times. The first is that even if the price of property falls, it may still be a wise investment. This may sound perverse, but property is a long-term investment, and not many others are both secure and pay a good return. So if government bonds are paying 0.5% interest a year, or even less, and property is making 3-5%, you still have a good source of income if you are a private investor or global investment fund.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:The second factor is that for all the talk of bricks and mortar being solid and unchanging, the sector has over the years proved to be remarkably flexible.Over time the use of land and buildings can change, and often it does so remarkably quickly. Look at the environment you live in, and there will be plenty of evidence of that - shops that are now flats, old factories that are now hotels, and warehouses that have become dance studios.  The coronavirus pandemic may be a massive shock to property markets, but it may well just speed up changes that are already taking place.",11 June 2020,business
The treasure trove hidden in discarded computers,"What do you do with an old hard disk drive, the kind that still spins up inside most PCs, once it reaches the end of its life?If Allan Walton has his way, parts of it could soon be propelling your next car along the road, assuming you go electric.The University of Birmingham professor is a director in the firm Hypromag, which extracts and recycles neodymium magnets from used hard disks.  Neodymium is a rare earth metal - chemical elements considered essential ingredients in many of today’s must-have technologies, from smartphones to TV screens. Neodymium is used, among other things, to make magnets that turn the motors that drive electric vehicles.Prof Walton believes that in the next 10 years, his company could be recycling enough neodymium to meet a quarter of the UK’s demand - almost all of which is currently imported from China.Once electric vehicles are assembled and running, they are broadly seen as being more environmentally friendly than cars with an internal combustion engine. But making magnets from rare earths is far from green.Though processes needed to refine rare earths use many of the same chemicals found in oven cleaners and cosmetics, their waste can be destructive if not properly controlled. At one mining site, Bayan Obo in Inner Mongolia, they have contributed to a vast toxic lake.Next to the mine itself is a tailing dam, a reservoir created by what is left over from separating rare earths. Steel and aluminium already have large established recycling programmes which help to reduce chemical processing. However, rare earth minerals used in phones, hard drives and old wind turbines are generally lost. Four years ago at the University of Birmingham, Prof Walton and his mentor, Prof Rex Harris, discovered that running hydrogen gas through old hard-disk drives turns the magnets into powder which can be harvested, re-packed and coated, to become new magnets.Not only will the project offer a greener solution to the rare earths market, the global demand for these minerals means there is a business case to be built. “We are missing a trick. There is no trouble finding rare earths, it’s the processing them into a useful material, like a magnet,” says Prof Walton.This year, Hypromag expects to announce a deal with the UK car company Bentley. It has received a £2.6m grant from Innovate UK and a half a million pounds of investment and further partnership from an African junior mine, Mkango. However, the Hypromag solution will only meet a fraction of the growing demand for rare earths, which analysts estimate will double by 2025.Prof Walton believes that if Britain acts now and creates a scaled-up rare earths recycling industry, it could become a world leader.The opportunity is huge, with many emerging technologies such as 5G demanding rare earths, on top of the growing need for established technologies such as phone handsets, microprocessors and wind turbines.However, the main reason rare earths have been compared to oil, is government policies that will fuel the demand for electric vehicles. After 2025, the Netherlands will not sell petrol or diesel cars. The UK and France have pledged to meet this goal by 2040. This year, China aims for 12% of cars sold in the country to produce zero emissions.When it comes to the production of rare earths and magnets made from them, China is the world leader. The country corners the market because its companies can mine rare earths and process them locally into finished products. More than 70% of rare earth products are exported by China.More Technology of BusinessThe country corners the market because it is the only place in the world with companies that can make rare earth minerals into finished products. More than 70% of rare earth products are exported by China.And, its established supply chain offers them unmatchable discounts.Rare earths are part of the Made in China 2025 plan to become the world’s leading manufacturer.But while China exports processed products, the country’s natural resources are not rich in heavier types of rare earth that are most in demand, like the neodymium used for car magnets. China gets most of its neodymium from Burma and the United States, says Christopher Ecclestone, a mining strategist at Hallgarten. The Mountain Pass mine in California sells 100% of its rare earths in a concentrated form to China - and is part-owned by Chinese firm Shenghe Resources, which has a 9.9% stake. “The US is one of China’s largest sources of rare earths and the Chinese are taking it for a song. It drives the Pentagon crazy,” he says. What put China in control of the market was that rare earths were a by-product of already established mines, says Ian Higgins, the director of Less Common Metals in Ellesmere Port near Liverpool. Mr Higgins's firm is one of the only manufacturers outside of China to make and combine rare earth metals into alloys. He points out that Chinese mines are supported by government subsidies and opaque accounting practices. While environmental policy in China has improved, the largest mines were built before their implementation. “There is a lot of processing of rare earths which is horrific and there is also a lot of black and grey market smuggling of heavier rare earths.”  says Mr Higgins. However, he adds that the country is beginning to wake up to the environmental impact of its rare earths industry.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused global assembly lines to grind to a halt. But it has also spurred manufacturers who use rare earths to question the global supply chain and their reliance on a single source country.The crisis has pushed governments and businesses to ""localise resources,"", according to Andrew Bloodworth a director at the British Geological Survey.“People like me tell our government that any production that is concentrated in small places will be vulnerable to disruption,” says Mr Bloodworth. America, the UK and Europe are trying to build supply chains for rare earths outside of China. On 13 May, legislation was put before US legislators, aimed at giving tax breaks to the industry - $50m in funding was also earmarked for start-up mines in the US.In the EU, the Horizon 2020 fund has launched an initiative to build a supply chain across several European and Nordic countries, including Britain. In the UK, rare earths are integral to the government’s industrial strategy, according to Jeff Townsend, who this year set up a lobbying firm to represent the industry’s interests. “Government needs to understand and do more than set out a grand vision of an industrial strategy. It needs to get its hands dirty and provide the supply chain,” he says.  “Covid has knocked everyone sideways and lots of people are looking again at the way we do things,” says Mr Townsend. He adds: “If we make the decision that we want to be better, then we have to try to be better because that’s the only way we change society.”",9 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Marmite says pub shutdown means no larger jars for now,"Marmite lovers who haven't been able to buy larger jars of the spread during lockdown can blame the coronavirus.Unilever, which owns the brand, says it has temporarily stopped producing all pack sizes other than its 250g jar, prompting a flurry of complaints on social media. The firm blamed surging demand and a shortage of brewer's yeast, a key ingredient.But it promised that normal supply would resume soon. Fans of the spread, which is famous for dividing opinion, took to Twitter to vent their dismay at the shortage. ""I need Marmite like oxygen and really need more 400g squeezy jars. Can you advise on which retailers stock those at the moment? Thank you,"" tweeted Tim Robey.  Another quipped: ""I've just turned the news on to hear of a Marmite shortage - just when we thought 2020 couldn't get any worse."" Yeast by-product, generated when brewers make beer, is a key ingredient in Marmite. However, with pubs having been closed since March to battle Covid-19, there has been a shortage of late. At the same time, Unilever said that more people preparing meals at home during lockdown had caused a surge in demand for the spread. As a result, it said its factory in Burton-on-Trent had temporarily limited supply, although production levels are now back to normal. ""With these issues now resolved, we are continuing to make Marmite as normal again, which means that the full range of jars should be back on supermarket shelves very shortly,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.",11 June 2020,business
"British Gas owner Centrica to cut 5,000 jobs","Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is to cut 5,000 jobs this year to ""arrest the decline"" of the company.The company has been losing customers to rivals and, in February, blamed a big loss in 2019 on the energy price cap and falling gas prices.Centrica also said the coronavirus crisis had shown how the company could be ""agile and responsive"".New boss Chris O'Shea said most of the cuts would fall in the UK as the energy giant seeks to slim down its business.About half of the jobs to go will be among the company's leadership, management and corporate staff. This will include half of the senior leadership team of 40 who will leave by the end of August.Centrica currently has about 27,000 employees, with 20,000 of these based in the UK. Mr O'Shea was officially appointed as Centrica chief executive in April, having previously been the company's finance director. He took over from Iain Conn, who had said last summer that he intended to leave the role.""Since becoming chief executive almost three months ago, I've focused on navigating the company through the Covid-19 crisis and identifying what needs to change in Centrica,"" Mr O'Shea said.""We've learnt through the crisis that we can be agile and responsive in the most difficult conditions and put our customers at the heart of our decision making.""I truly regret that these difficult decisions will have to be made and understand the impact on the colleagues who will leave us. However, the changes we are proposing to make are designed to arrest our decline, allow us to focus on our customers and create a sustainable company."" The GMB union said it would ""fight for every job"".""A combination of the [energy price] cap and too little, too late management decisions have left a once proud brand crippled and weak,"" said spokesman Justin Bowden.""Slashing thousands more jobs is not the answer. You cannot just cut your way out of a crisis.""The price cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was a flagship policy of former Prime Minister Theresa May to end what she called ""rip-off"" prices.A number of energy companies have said the policy has affected their business and profits. Centrica made a loss of £849m in the last calendar year compared with a £987m profit the year before.The energy sector has seen a number of smaller suppliers fail, and other companies have been looking to merge.Last month, Ovo Energy - which bought SSE's retail division earlier in 2020, making it the UK's second biggest domestic gas and electricity supplier - said it was cutting 2,600 jobs.Centrica also said it would be consulting with staff on ""simplifying"" terms and conditions for employees in the UK. It said it had 80 different employee contracts, each with multiple variants, with many of the agreements more than 35 years-old.",11 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Renewed push for 'travel corridors',"UK industry bodies have again pushed the government to allow ""travel corridor"" deals with other countries.They want to know when and how ministers will agree deals with other countries so more people would be exempt from new quarantine rules for people arriving into the UK.The business and university groups say it is vital for the economy that the UK begins to open up to trading partners.The government said it was continuing to consider such travel corridors.A range of organisations representing businesses across the UK have written to ministers asking them for clarity on how and when the government might relax travel restrictions.The bosses of groups representing industry, tourism, hospitality and universities, as well as regional and national chambers of commerce said it was ""vital"" that the UK began to open up for trade.Business campaign group London First, which organised the letter, said over 1.5 million jobs across the UK are supported by air transport.In a letter to the home secretary, the foreign secretary, and the transport secretary, the group made three demands.They want more detail on how and when the government will agree travel corridors with countries with low infection rates, so passengers on certain routes will not have to self-isolate for two weeks when they arrive in the UK.They also want to know when the Foreign Office will move away from its current blanket advice against all but essential travel abroad.They argue a more nuanced approach is needed, based on the risk posed by individual countries.Finally they call for a more comprehensive strategy on health screening at the border. They say businesses have to plan, so they need to know when journeys abroad might be possible again.""As we look to recover from the economic shock that Covid-19 has delivered, it will be vital that we start to open the UK up to our trading partners,"" the signatories said.The groups, which include the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said that whole sectors of the UK economy ""simply won't recover and thrive without international connections"".Business and tourism groups have been urging the government to relax quarantine restrictions to aid the UK economy.In May, industry groups said the UK risks being left behind without air bridges, while tourism organisations also backed those calls.A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise this is a challenging period for businesses and have announced an unprecedented package of support measures to help them, while also trying to avoid a second peak of this deadly virus by managing the risk of cases being imported from abroad.""Our focus is implementing measures which help tackle the spread of the disease and protect public health. The government is continuing to consider the travel corridors concept as a possible way of relaxing border measures and increasing travel once it is safe to do so. ""We are monitoring the global travel situation closely and keeping our advice against all non-essential travel under continuous review.""",11 June 2020,business
Firms can't cope with no deal and virus - CBI boss,"British firms do not have the resilience to cope with a no-deal Brexit after the battering of the coronavirus crisis, according to the outgoing boss of industry body the CBI.Carolyn Fairbairn said a CBI member had likened a no-deal to ""setting the shed on fire"" while the house was in flames.Brexit trade negotiations have not been going well between the UK and the EU.A government spokesperson said the UK wanted to reach an agreement with the EU this year.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC that any buffers to cope with the additional cost and planning of an exit from the EU customs union and single market without a deal had been exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The resilience of British business is absolutely on the floor,"" she said.""Every penny of cash that had been stored up, all the stockpiles prepared have been run down.""The firms that I speak to have not a spare moment to plan for a no trade deal Brexit at the end of the year - that is the common sense voice that needs to find its way into these negotiations.""Those negotiations are not going well. They broke up last week with the EU's chief negotiator saying that very little progress had been made on key sticking points, including future fishing rights in UK waters, and commitments to maintain a ""level playing field"" over regulation and competition. The devastating impact of Covid-19 and the fight for business survival has diverted management attention away from any Brexit contingency planning, according to Dame Carolyn, who worries that a political commitment to abandon the current transitional trading arrangements - come what may - will add to the burden on business at a critical moment. ""As one member put it to me - just because the house is on fire, it doesn't make it ok to set fire to the garden shed.""If we have a political timescale that takes us to a brinksmanship deal in December that will be catastrophic for British business - they will not be ready.""Small businesses were not ready last time there was a no-deal Brexit threat - this time they will not have had a moment to prepare for it.""Dame Carolyn's comments come as the CBI - the UK's most influential business group - confirmed she will be succeeded as director general by Tony Danker in November.Mr Danker is currently chief executive of Be the Business, an organisation set up to improve the efficiency and productivity of UK businesses. A former media executive, he was also a policy adviser to the Treasury.Relations between business groups and the government have been strained ever since the campaign leading up to the EU referendum of 2016, when business groups, including the CBI, warned of economic damage to the UK economy whose biggest customer is the EU. Dame Carolyn is hopeful that this crisis can help build bridges in the face of a common and deadly health and economic enemy. ""Government realises it needs business and business understands how much it needs government,"" she said.She described the government's intervention to support workers wages during the lockdown as a ""vital way for the economy to hibernate"".But the CBI on Thursday urged the government to focus on how the UK emerges from that hibernation.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Dame Carolyn called on the government to make employment for young workers the government's top priority, as well as ensuring the UK emerges from the crisis with a focus on investment in environmentally sustainable industries. Dame Carolyn was set to stand down this year anyway, but agreed to extend her term until the end of the year given the ongoing health and economic crisis. This is not the swansong she would have wanted. The UK is forecast to experience the worst economic downturn of any major European economy according to figures out yesterday from the OECD.A government spokesperson said: ""We've been clear that we want to reach an agreement with the EU this year and we are prepared to work hard to accelerate talks. This was what both sides agreed to in the political declaration.""If we don't negotiate a Canada-style FTA [free trade agreement], we'll leave with an Australia-style relationship. Whatever happens we will be leaving the single market and customs union at the end of this year.""We have taken unprecedented action to support businesses through this pandemic and to ensure the UK's economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible. Extending the transition period would simply prolong the negotiations and create more uncertainty for businesses.""",11 June 2020,business
