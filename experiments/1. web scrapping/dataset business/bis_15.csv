Nissan backs UK plant as it unveils survival plan,"Nissan's UK factory in Sunderland will stay open as the Japanese carmaker carries out a global restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic.It will close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs after the firm plunged to a $6.2bn (£5bn) net loss in the last financial year.Nissan is cutting production and car models after sales fell before and during the Covid-19 outbreak.The company's net loss is its first for more than 10 years.Nissan is part of a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which are restructuring global operations to enable them to work more closely and cut costs.Nissan said on Thursday it would focus on several ""key markets"", including Japan, North America and China.In a press briefing, its boss said that it will ""sustain"" its presence in Europe but will leave more room for alliance partners there, such as Renault. There has been speculation that Renault could switch some production to the Sunderland factory.Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida told the press briefing the company would maintain production at its Sunderland plant.It will begin building cars there again in June, after production was paused due to coronavirus-related lockdown measures.Before the suspension, the factory was preparing for production of the next-generation Qashqai, due out next year. The factory, the UK's biggest car plant, employs about 7,000 people.Mr Uchida described the closure of the Barcelona factory as ""a very difficult decision"".""The loss of the jobs of our Spanish colleagues is a regrettable reminder that automotive manufacturing is facing tremendous challenges,"" said Steve Bush, national officer for automotive at the Unite union.He added that Unite is seeking assurances from Nissan ""that the cost-cutting measures spoken about will not impact on our members' jobs, terms and conditions or other benefits at Europe's most efficient plant, Sunderland.""This is good news. For today, Nissan workers can breathe a sigh of relief that Sunderland has been recognised as an important production facility for the future. However, lots of questions remain. Nissan has identified Japan, North America and China as ""core"" markets - not Europe. In Europe, Nissan's alliance partner Renault will assume a greater role and influence in Europe at a time when the global car market will have to make very aggressive cost reductions. The question may arise in the future - who is really in charge in Europe? If it's Renault, what does that mean for future investment in a post-Brexit UK? Nissan alone said it had capacity to make seven million cars when it only needs capacity for five million. Only plants that can demonstrate an ability to be ruthless about cost will continue to attract investment. As Professor David Bailey tweeted this morning: ""Once again, the workforce will have to pull out all the stops to work flexibly to get costs down"". So, some belt tightening ahead, but workers in Sunderland will be thankful they are not in the same position as their counterparts in Spain and Indonesia, where plants closed down.On Thursday, Nissan also outlined plans to reduce the range of models of cars and trucks available in order to cut costs.It said it would reduce the number of models from 69 to about 55 over the next few years, focusing instead on electric vehicles and sports cars.Nissan said that worldwide sales of its vehicles between January and April had dropped by 31.1% in comparison with the same period last year.But even before the Covid-19 outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been falling, forcing it to pull back from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.The carmaker's operating profit had tumbled for four years in a row as it chased market share, particularly in America, leading to overcapacity at its car plants and steep discounts.The pandemic added yet more pressure on the company to step up its cost-cutting efforts. On Thursday the company said it was too difficult to forecast its performance in the next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Uchida said that the firm's key focus during the pandemic was now to ""pursue steady growth"", instead of the massive sales expansion it pursued in the past.",28 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes. And where our employees take their breaks in rest areas, we've limited the occupancy of those areas, and created some temporary additional rest areas.""He says employees will also be given a ""multi-tool"" to do things like opening doors or operating push-button microwaves, in order to avoid touching surfaces that could harbour infection.All workers will have to wear masks and each of them will have an individual bottle of hand sanitiser to use. These measures, Mr Freeman stresses, have been drawn up in consultation with Unite, the factory workers' union.Unite representative Pete Tsouvallaris says he is very happy with the measures that have been drawn up. The problem now, he believes, is persuading shop floor staff that they really can come to work safely.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""Many of our members are obviously worried because they haven't been on site yet,"" he says. ""Those who have been on site and have seen the steps that are being taken are less concerned. But what really doesn't help is the mixed messages coming from the government. It's confusing.""For Mr Tsouvallaris, the main concern is what happens when production gets under way in earnest. He is worried that workers might find it difficult to maintain all the new precautions.""Building cars is uncomfortable at the best of times,"" he says, ""so what is going to happen when it gets hot and you're wearing masks and lots of PPE?""The risk, he says, is that if production rates rise too quickly workers might become careless. He thinks it is essential that managers stay ""reasonable"" with their demands.He is also worried about what could happen at smaller suppliers, who have smaller premises and fewer resources than the big car firms. Reopening factories is just part of the story, however. Although some cars are sold online or through other remote channels, most still find their way to buyers through dealer showrooms - and in the UK, those showrooms remain closed.So it is no surprise that the first factories to reopen are those supplying markets abroad. JLR's Solihull plant, for example, makes models that are popular in China - where sales are recovering.Graham Hoare, chairman of Ford of Britain, thinks it is vital that British showrooms are able to open as soon as possible.""Dealerships being open is a fundamental requirement to selling cars,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our products go through dealerships.""Opening those dealerships… that really unblocks the cork out of the bottle that then allows the whole manufacturing system to flow.""That's already happened on the continent - in Germany and the rest of Europe. It's building, and we need to do the same here.""People will only buy cars if they can afford them though, and with the economy expected to go into a steep recession, that can not be guaranteed.""Invariably, if consumer confidence is low, you're looking at tightening belts,"" admits Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.Nevertheless, he says it is essential that showrooms reopen soon.""If you reopen retail, you can stimulate demand… and that will help manufacturing. Do that right and the benefits in terms of the economy, and in terms of people's jobs and livelihoods will be felt pretty quickly.""",14 May 2020,business

"Coronavirus: EasyJet plans up to 4,500 job cuts","EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic.The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020.Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"".EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023.It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts.It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt.""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said.EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs.""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future.""Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include:The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals.From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a £1,000 fine.In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad.Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June.It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July.Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June.The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel.""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa.""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added.""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction.""Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"".She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of £600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft.""She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company.EasyJet reaffirmed that it would be introducing security measures to protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights.These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals.The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

Trump to 'sign executive order about social media',"US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said.It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices.The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time.The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress.White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday.Before leaving Washington for Florida to watch a space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence.Mr Trump also continued his criticism of social media platforms on Twitter, ending a tweet with: ""Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!""Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen!

Stay Tuned!!!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday when one of his posts was given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".On Wednesday Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms.He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Mr Trump wrote a similar post on Facebook about mail-in ballots on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday.Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach was helping fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.Some of America's biggest technology companies have also been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating their users' privacy.

Murdoch shuts 112 Australia print papers in major digital shift,"Rupert Murdoch's newspaper business in Australia has said more than 100 of its newspapers will become digital-only or disappear entirely.From next month it will make 76 regional and local papers online-only and close another 36 altogether. News Corp Australia said the move will mean job losses but did not say how many roles would be cut.The coronavirus lockdown has hit advertising revenues, accelerating a downturn in the nation's media sector.The executive chairman of the News Corp operation, Michael Miller, highlighted how the pandemic had hit business: ""Covid-19 has impacted the sustainability of community and regional publishing.""Consequently, to meet these changing trends, we are reshaping News Corp Australia to focus on where consumers and businesses are moving and to strengthen our position as Australia's leading digital news media company.""Under the plan, News Corp's major daily newspapers, including the Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph, will become more state focused, drawing content from regional and community journalists.Larger regional papers, such as the Hobart Mercury or NT News, will continue to be published in their print form.The roots of Mr Murdoch's global empire are in Australian newspapers. But like much of the rest of the world, Australia's traditional media industry has come under under intense pressure in recent years as advertisers turn to internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google.Several media companies in the country have already made cuts or shut down completely during the pandemic, with the latest including Buzzfeed Australia and 10 Daily, a news website of ViacomCBS-owned broadcaster Ten Network.Earlier this year the Australian Associated Press, a newswire which was part-owned by News Corp, announced its closure after 85 years.News Corp has been leading an ongoing campaign to make online firms pay for the Australian content they share.",28 May 2020,business
Travel firms say quarantine plan must be scrapped,"Dozens of travel firms and hotel owners have said the UK should scrap plans to force visitors to quarantine on arrival.From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a £1,000 fine.But the holiday firms and hotels are worried that will be bad for business.In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, they say the policy would reduce visitor numbers and may make it harder for Brits to travel abroad.The letter, which is signed by more than 70 travel bosses, says the sector is ""severely challenged"".""The very last thing the travel industry needs is a mandatory quarantine imposed on all arriving passengers which will deter foreign visitors from coming here, deter UK visitors from travelling abroad, and most likely cause other countries to impose reciprocal quarantine requirements on British visitors,"" the letter says.Instead, it says the government's decision not to force visitors to isolate on arrival, before the crisis put the country into lockdown, had supported the spread of the virus.""Many people urged the government to impose quarantine regulations during the early phases of Covid-19,"" the letter reads.""Instead, no action was taken and flights from many infected countries were allowed to land, making it easy for thousands of potentially affected passengers to spread the virus into the wider UK community.""A Home Office spokesperson said: ""As the world begins to emerge from what we hope is the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, we must look to the future and protect the British public by reducing the risk of cases crossing our border.""We continue to support businesses in the tourism sector through one of the most generous economic packages provided anywhere in the world. However, it is right that we introduce these new measures now to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave.""There are a number of groups who are exempt, including:Initially, it was suggested the rules would also not apply to travellers from France. However, the government later insisted the quarantine measures will also apply to them.The travel firms say the sector contributed £200bn to the UK economy last year, around 9% of gross domestic product.But they say the government has been ""woefully slow to react and has procrastinated to the point of absurdity"" when considering support schemes for the industry during the crisis.The letter says the government ""must not exceed its mandate"". ""The people of this country do not wish to be prevented from travelling.""""Quite simply it is time to switch the emphasis from protection to economic recovery before it is too late.""",28 May 2020,business
Nissan backs UK plant as it unveils survival plan,"Nissan's UK factory in Sunderland will stay open as the Japanese carmaker carries out a global restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic.It will close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs after the firm plunged to a $6.2bn (£5bn) net loss in the last financial year.Nissan is cutting production and car models after sales fell before and during the Covid-19 outbreak.The company's net loss is its first for more than 10 years.Nissan is part of a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which are restructuring global operations to enable them to work more closely and cut costs.Nissan said on Thursday it would focus on several ""key markets"", including Japan, North America and China.In a press briefing, its boss said that it will ""sustain"" its presence in Europe but will leave more room for alliance partners there, such as Renault. There has been speculation that Renault could switch some production to the Sunderland factory.Nissan chief executive Makoto Uchida told the press briefing the company would maintain production at its Sunderland plant.It will begin building cars there again in June, after production was paused due to coronavirus-related lockdown measures.Before the suspension, the factory was preparing for production of the next-generation Qashqai, due out next year. The factory, the UK's biggest car plant, employs about 7,000 people.Mr Uchida described the closure of the Barcelona factory as ""a very difficult decision"".""The loss of the jobs of our Spanish colleagues is a regrettable reminder that automotive manufacturing is facing tremendous challenges,"" said Steve Bush, national officer for automotive at the Unite union.He added that Unite is seeking assurances from Nissan ""that the cost-cutting measures spoken about will not impact on our members' jobs, terms and conditions or other benefits at Europe's most efficient plant, Sunderland.""This is good news. For today, Nissan workers can breathe a sigh of relief that Sunderland has been recognised as an important production facility for the future. However, lots of questions remain. Nissan has identified Japan, North America and China as ""core"" markets - not Europe. In Europe, Nissan's alliance partner Renault will assume a greater role and influence in Europe at a time when the global car market will have to make very aggressive cost reductions. The question may arise in the future - who is really in charge in Europe? If it's Renault, what does that mean for future investment in a post-Brexit UK? Nissan alone said it had capacity to make seven million cars when it only needs capacity for five million. Only plants that can demonstrate an ability to be ruthless about cost will continue to attract investment. As Professor David Bailey tweeted this morning: ""Once again, the workforce will have to pull out all the stops to work flexibly to get costs down"". So, some belt tightening ahead, but workers in Sunderland will be thankful they are not in the same position as their counterparts in Spain and Indonesia, where plants closed down.On Thursday, Nissan also outlined plans to reduce the range of models of cars and trucks available in order to cut costs.It said it would reduce the number of models from 69 to about 55 over the next few years, focusing instead on electric vehicles and sports cars.Nissan said that worldwide sales of its vehicles between January and April had dropped by 31.1% in comparison with the same period last year.But even before the Covid-19 outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been falling, forcing it to pull back from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.The carmaker's operating profit had tumbled for four years in a row as it chased market share, particularly in America, leading to overcapacity at its car plants and steep discounts.The pandemic added yet more pressure on the company to step up its cost-cutting efforts. On Thursday the company said it was too difficult to forecast its performance in the next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Uchida said that the firm's key focus during the pandemic was now to ""pursue steady growth"", instead of the massive sales expansion it pursued in the past.",28 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes. And where our employees take their breaks in rest areas, we've limited the occupancy of those areas, and created some temporary additional rest areas.""He says employees will also be given a ""multi-tool"" to do things like opening doors or operating push-button microwaves, in order to avoid touching surfaces that could harbour infection.All workers will have to wear masks and each of them will have an individual bottle of hand sanitiser to use. These measures, Mr Freeman stresses, have been drawn up in consultation with Unite, the factory workers' union.Unite representative Pete Tsouvallaris says he is very happy with the measures that have been drawn up. The problem now, he believes, is persuading shop floor staff that they really can come to work safely.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""Many of our members are obviously worried because they haven't been on site yet,"" he says. ""Those who have been on site and have seen the steps that are being taken are less concerned. But what really doesn't help is the mixed messages coming from the government. It's confusing.""For Mr Tsouvallaris, the main concern is what happens when production gets under way in earnest. He is worried that workers might find it difficult to maintain all the new precautions.""Building cars is uncomfortable at the best of times,"" he says, ""so what is going to happen when it gets hot and you're wearing masks and lots of PPE?""The risk, he says, is that if production rates rise too quickly workers might become careless. He thinks it is essential that managers stay ""reasonable"" with their demands.He is also worried about what could happen at smaller suppliers, who have smaller premises and fewer resources than the big car firms. Reopening factories is just part of the story, however. Although some cars are sold online or through other remote channels, most still find their way to buyers through dealer showrooms - and in the UK, those showrooms remain closed.So it is no surprise that the first factories to reopen are those supplying markets abroad. JLR's Solihull plant, for example, makes models that are popular in China - where sales are recovering.Graham Hoare, chairman of Ford of Britain, thinks it is vital that British showrooms are able to open as soon as possible.""Dealerships being open is a fundamental requirement to selling cars,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our products go through dealerships.""Opening those dealerships… that really unblocks the cork out of the bottle that then allows the whole manufacturing system to flow.""That's already happened on the continent - in Germany and the rest of Europe. It's building, and we need to do the same here.""People will only buy cars if they can afford them though, and with the economy expected to go into a steep recession, that can not be guaranteed.""Invariably, if consumer confidence is low, you're looking at tightening belts,"" admits Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.Nevertheless, he says it is essential that showrooms reopen soon.""If you reopen retail, you can stimulate demand… and that will help manufacturing. Do that right and the benefits in terms of the economy, and in terms of people's jobs and livelihoods will be felt pretty quickly.""",14 May 2020,business

"Coronavirus: EasyJet plans up to 4,500 job cuts","EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic.The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020.Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"".EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023.It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts.It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt.""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said.EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs.""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future.""Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include:The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals.From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a £1,000 fine.In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad.Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June.It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July.Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June.The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel.""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa.""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added.""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction.""Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"".She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of £600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft.""She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company.EasyJet reaffirmed that it would be introducing security measures to protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights.These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals.The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

Trump to 'sign executive order about social media',"US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said.It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices.The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time.The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress.White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday.Before leaving Washington for Florida to watch a space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence.Mr Trump also continued his criticism of social media platforms on Twitter, ending a tweet with: ""Now they are going absolutely CRAZY.

"Coronavirus: EasyJet plans up to 4,500 job cuts","EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30% of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic.The airline did not say exactly how many jobs would go, but it employed 15,000 people at the start of 2020.Pilots' union Balpa reacted angrily, describing the move as an ""ill-considered knee-jerk reaction"".EasyJet, which has big operations at Gatwick and Luton airports, confirmed it would restart flights on 15 June. However, it said that levels of market demand seen in 2019 were not likely to be reached again until 2023.It added that in the coming days, it would launch an employee consultation process on the planned job cuts.It grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt.""To effect the restructure of our business, EasyJet will shortly launch an employee consultation process on proposals to reduce staff numbers by up to 30%, reflecting the reduced fleet, the optimisation of our network and bases, improved productivity as well as the promotion of more efficient ways of working,"" the firm said.EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""We realise that these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people, but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long-term. He said the airline was planning to reduce the size of its fleet and would continue to cut costs.""We want to ensure that we emerge from the pandemic an even more competitive business than before, so that easyJet can thrive in the future.""Other airlines have already announced job cuts and restructuring programmes as they fight to stay in business. These include:The travel industry's hopes of reopening for business as global lockdowns ease have been dealt a blow by the UK government's plan to introduce a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals.From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad, including returning holidaymakers, will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a £1,000 fine.In a letter to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, hotels and holiday firms said the policy would reduce visitor numbers and could make it harder for Britons to travel abroad.Meanwhile, tour operator Tui has said all its holidays for UK customers will now be suspended until at least the end of June. It had previously cancelled all trips up to 11 June.It has also suspended its Marella Cruises sailings until 30 July.Rival tour operator Jet2holidays has also suspended its holidays until 30 June.The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all but essential international travel.""EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago, staff got a 'good news' message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth,"" said Brian Strutton of Balpa.""Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return. EasyJet has not discussed its plans with Balpa, so we will wait and see what impact there will be in the UK,"" he added.""EasyJet's own projections, though on the pessimistic side, point to recovery by 2023, so this is a temporary problem that doesn't need this ill-considered knee-jerk reaction.""Lindsey Olliver, the EasyJet officer for the Unite union, said the airline had made ""an unnecessarily hasty decision"".She added: ""The workforce is currently furloughed under the government's job retention scheme and the airline will continue to receive support until at least October. ""It has also received a government-backed loan of £600m and has committed to expenditure on new aircraft.""She said Unite did not know where the job losses were planned and would be seeking ""clarification"" from the company.EasyJet reaffirmed that it would be introducing security measures to protect against the spread of coronavirus when it resumes flights.These include requiring passengers and crew to wear masks and not offering on-board meals.The airline said it would release half-year results, covering the six months to the end of March, on 30 June.

Trump to 'sign executive order about social media',"US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said.It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices.The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time.The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress.White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday.Before leaving Washington for Florida to watch a space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence.Mr Trump also continued his criticism of social media platforms on Twitter, ending a tweet with: ""Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!""Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen!

In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Mr Trump wrote a similar post on Facebook about mail-in ballots on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday.Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach was helping fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.Some of America's biggest technology companies have also been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating their users' privacy.

""Our industry will come back but it will take some years to return to what it was just two months ago.""Even before the pandemic, the crisis at Boeing, which forced it to halt 737 manufacturing in January, was expected to be a major drag on the US economy.

Coronavirus: Young could be scarred throughout working life,"The International Labour Organisation has said young people are disproportionately being affected by the coronavirus health crisis.In a new report the ILO, which is a United Nations agency, warns there is a risk they could be scarred throughout their working lives.They could become what the report calls a ""lockdown generation"".It says young women have been especially hit by the increase in unemployment.Young people have been affected by what the report calls ""a triple shock"".The virus, it says, is destroying their employment, disrupting education and training and putting obstacles in the way of those who want to start work or change jobs.One in five have stopped work since the onset of the pandemic.Among those who have remained in employment, working hours have declined by almost a quarter. Before the crisis, more than 40% of young people were working in hard-hit sectors such as accommodation, food services and retailing. Three quarters were in informal employment and therefore had little protection if they do lose their jobs. In Africa, the figure is more than 90%. Education and training, including ""on the job"" programmes are suffering massive disruption, the ILO says. A great deal of training is now being done at a distance, online. But the ILO says few low-income countries have managed to make that transition.  The agency calls for targeted intervention by governments to guarantee employment and training for young people in low and middle-income countries that may need foreign support both for finance and implementation.The report also says that rigorous testing and tracing of infections strongly translates to lower labour market disruption than do confinement and lockdown measures. The ILO argues that testing and tracing improves the chances of what it calls an employment-rich recovery. ",27 May 2020,business
"Record drop in energy investment, warns International Energy Agency","The coronavirus crisis is causing the biggest fall in global energy investment in history. Before the pandemic, funding was set to rise 2%, but now it’s predicted to plunge 20%, says the International Energy Agency (IEA).Fossil fuels are hit hardest, with a 30% funding drop expected for oil and a 15% fall for coal.Renewables investment is down 10% - and it's only about half what’s needed to combat climate change.Due to coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by many countries, for the time being, the fall in investment is leading to a drop in planet-heating carbon emissions.But the IEA warns that that use of fossil fuels is likely to rebound when the crisis is over, leading to a spike in CO2.One reason is because China and other Asian nations are putting in orders now for a new generation of coal-fired power plants to supply energy in the future.“We see a historical decline in emissions, but unless we have the right economic recovery packages, we might see emissions again skyrocket and the decline of this year would be completely wasted,"" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol told the BBC.“Remember the 2008-2009 crashes. We immediately saw a decline in emissions, but afterwards it rebounded. We must learn from history.”Approvals of new coal plants in the first quarter of 2020, mainly in China, were running at twice the rate observed over the whole of 2019, he added.Overall energy investment has fallen almost $400bn (£324.3bn) short of what was expected in 2020, and the IEA says there are now serious doubts about secure energy supplies when the global economy picks up, because energy projects take so long to deliver.The report says the decline in investment is “staggering” in its scale and swiftness, mostly due to low demand and low prices for energy, especially oil.Dr Birol said: “The historic plunge in investment is deeply troubling. It means lost jobs and economic opportunities today, as well as lost energy supply that we might well need tomorrow, once the economy recovers. “The slowdown in spending also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more sustainable energy systems.” The report says a combination of falling demand, lower prices and a rise in non-payment of bills means energy revenues to governments and industry are set to fall by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. Oil accounts for most of the total of this decline. Shale gas – previously the darling of the energy sector - is anticipated to take the biggest percentage hit overall, with a 50% investment fall.Renewables investment has been more resilient, but spending on rooftop solar installations by has been strongly affected. Energy efficiency is suffering too, as investment is set to fall by an estimated 10-15%.The overall share of global energy spending that goes to clean energy has been stuck at around one-third in recent years.In 2020 it will jump towards 40% of total investment - but that’s only relative, because fossil fuels are taking such a battering.Dr Birol added: “The crisis has brought lower emissions but for all the wrong reasons. If we are to achieve a lasting reduction in global emissions, then we will need to see a rapid increase in clean energy investment.”Decisions to commission new coal-fired plants are down more than 80% since 2015, but the global coal fleet continues to grow.Follow Roger on Twitter.",27 May 2020,business
UK furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workers,"Some 8.4 million workers are now covered by the government's furlough scheme, up from eight million a week earlier, the Treasury has said.Claims for subsidies filed by employers rose to £15bn from £11.1bn, it added.The scheme, brought in to mitigate the effects of coronavirus, allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500.A similar scheme for self-employed workers saw 2.3 million claims made worth £6.8bn.The Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, as it is known, differs from the furlough scheme because it is a grant paid out in a single instalment covering three months and amounting to 80% of average profit.The furlough scheme, officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was originally intended to last until the end of July, but has now been extended until the end of October.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed that it will continue to provide the same level of earnings, but has said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August.Sources have told the BBC the Treasury still expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October.Marketing professional Sian Melonie, from Hackney in east London, is one of the many people who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to benefit from the government's furlough scheme or its help for self-employed workers.After 12 years in work, she decided to go self-employed last year and began working for a large cinema group.She was due to start a fixed-term contract from 30 March, but that offer was withdrawn when the pandemic hit.""l don't qualify for any support. I can't be furloughed and I don't qualify for self-employed benefits, because I'm new to it,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm one of the people who slipped through the cracks.""But Sian says she is not angry and is using her savings to tide her over. ""However, my concern is how much longer it goes on for, because l am essentially spending what l had saved for my self-assessment tax for later this year. ""I'm hoping things get back to normal and the economy can bounce back.""Recent figures from the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, indicate that the cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic is expected to hit £123.2bn.The wages for nearly 11 million jobs are currently being paid by the taxpayer amid the still ongoing pandemic shutdowns. Supporting a third of all jobs at £22bn bill so far is still believed to represent value for money by the Government. The 8.4 million on the furlough scheme have kept their contractual relationship with their bosses. Those jobs can be ""switched back on"" as lockdowns are lifted. Not all of them will be, but it has been an incredible logistical effort from HMRC to process this. And in the next few days the Treasury will announce that employers will enjoy more flexibility, enabling them to bring back furloughed workers part time. They will though, get a smaller rate of subsidy from August.However, the self employment scheme remains due for expiry within days.The level of unemployment - which has been kept much lower than it would have been - will inevitably go up as support is phased away. But Downing Street appears to have developed a taste for such intervention. With recovery like to take longer than originally hoped, versions of such schemes are likely to be with us for some time.The OBR expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, which would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two.It said it had increased its estimate because of the rising cost of the furlough scheme.If you have been affected by the furlough scheme, email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.",27 May 2020,business
Find out which masks offer the most protection and why,"While paper and cloth masks may help controlling the spread of Covid-19 amongst the general public, they're certainly not up to the mark for use in intensive care.Here, where the risk of infection is at its greatest, medical staff need personal protective equipment of a far higher standard, capable of shielding them completely from the virus. The simplest form of face covering is the surgical mask, generally made of three layers of paper or cloth. They're resistant to droplets such as those caused by coughing or sneezing, but give little protection against viral particles themselves, which are only around 100 nanometres in size (a nanometre being a billionth of a metre).""A mask, which goes over your nose and mouth, but doesn't fit tightly to your face, is really there to be a barrier for any particles that you might expel,"" explains Dr Nikki McCullough, head of safety for 3M, one of the world's biggest suppliers of respiratory protection. ""The mask isn't going to prevent you from breathing in very small particles.""Respirators, on the other hand, are designed to fit tightly to the face, so that no air can leak in or out, and require a rigorous fitting process.""When you breathe in, all the air goes through the filter media, and that filter media has been tested to a performance standard,"" says Dr McCullough. ""So you can be sure that if you get a good seal to your face, the respirator is reducing the number of particles that you're going to breathe into your lungs.""Respirators come in various different forms, the simplest being mask-like filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators; some are designed to be disposable, whereas others can be disinfected and reused.More Technology of BusinessIn the US, FFP respirators are classified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in terms of the percentage of particles they filter out. Thus, N95 and N99 masks filter out 95% and 99% of particles respectively, while N100 devices eliminate 99.97%. In Europe, respirators are classified slightly differently. Respirators rated FFP1 filter out at least 80% of particles; FFP2s remove at least 94%, and FFP3 devices correspond to N100 by filtering out at least 99.97%.Meanwhile, similar to an FFP3 mask in effectiveness, but certainly not in appearance, are diving helmet-style powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs).""There you have a more comprehensive solution. There's a hood face shield and a tube that would connect into a unit on the belt,"" says Brian Hovey, chief marketing officer for major respirator manufacturer Honeywell. ""That has an engine or a motor that pumps air through a filter: it's part of a white suit, so it's a more comprehensive protective solution.""At the University of Southampton, engineers have developed a PAPR that they're supplying to University Hospital Southampton - 1,000 are already in use. It's currently undergoing the official rating and approval process, so it's not yet in use in intensive care or triage, where FFP3 respirators are required. However, two firms are making them and 5,000 have been ordered for staff in other settings.The testing process involved both a smell test to see whether the wearer could detect outside smells, as well as a physical test of whether tiny particles are indeed filtered out.""We put a petri dish inside the hood and another one outside, and delivered 1,000 litres of air through the filter,"" explains Alex Dickinson, an associate professor in the university's bioengineering science research group.""We incubated them for 24 hours at 37C and then counted how many of these colony-forming units had been transmitted through the filter and hood. On our first experiment, we saw no units of bacterial growth inside the hood, but ten formed on the control plate outside.""The British Standards Institute is currently evaluating the device against European standards, after which, hopes the team, it can be used more widely at Southampton and elsewhere.""Your vision is much better, and your communication is better, as the patient can see your whole face; your efficiency is much better as you can move from patient to patient without putting on and taking off your PPE,"" says hospital consultant and professor in respiratory medicine Paul Elkington.""Once we started rolling it out, one of the healthcare assistants said to me 'I've been feeling sick with nerves about coming in, but now I feel secure'.""Until recently, the market for respirators was mainly industrial - manufacturing, construction and the like.""If we look at six months ago, with full-face respirators - FFP2s and FFP3s - demand from healthcare was very low,"" says Dr McCullough. ""They really only used them for tuberculosis, maybe a measles case. But now we see that healthcare everywhere in the world is using respirators at a much, much higher rate.""As a result, manufacturers have been working flat out to increase capacity to meet the new demand.""We've made significant investment in both ramping up capacity at our existing facilities as well as new facilities. Most notably, in the US, we've just had our first products coming off the line in our Smithfield, Rhode Island facility, and we hit 500,000 units earlier this past week,"" says Honeywell's Brian Hovey. ""Similarly, we've ramped up our build capacity and we're starting to get product out in Phoenix. These new facilities are adding about 20 million units per month, and we're evaluating potential new facilities around the globe.""Dr McCullough says that 3M is also increasing production, adding extra shifts and improving efficiency.""We can make the same products but more quickly; we are adding new lines and we are looking at some small changes to certain products, looking at new headbands, for example,"" she says. So will the global supply hold up?""In the immediate term, probably not, unfortunately - the uptick we've seen has been unprecedented and depending on how people are thinking of them as a consumer product, demand far outstrips global supply,"" says Mr Hovey.But, he adds, ""We're having a good dialogue with governments around preparing for the future, and we make sure that strategic stockpiles are adequately supplied. ""If - god forbid - another situation like this occurs, collectively we'll be able to respond quickly and effectively.""",26 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Hardship risk 'could undermine test and trace system',"Workers self-isolating under the new test and trace systems could be pushed into hardship, union warnings claim.The programmes, newly launched in England and Scotland, risked being ineffective unless these people were helped financially, the TUC said.Employees could be told to stay at home for 14 days on multiple occasions and face an income drop on sick pay.Those receiving £95 a week or even ineligible for statutory sick pay may feel forced to work, the TUC said.""That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire test and trace programme,"" the union body's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said.Under the new systems, tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with.Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick and if they have already had the virus.While some employers will pay wages in full to those who are self-isolating, and some staff will request to take the time as their fully-paid holiday entitlement. some bosses will give people statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week. Guidance from the government says this should be paid from day one of isolation.Employers with fewer than 250 members of staff are now able to claim that cost back from the government, under a separate scheme launched earlier in the week.But some workers, often women working part-time, are ineligible for statutory sick pay as they do not earn an average of £120 a week, or are self-employed.They may have to fall back on the benefits system, or any self-employment support scheme, while off work.""The government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what they're paid - and raise it to the level of the real Living Wage, £260 per week,"" Ms O'Grady said.""And the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate.""The view was echoed by charity Citizens Advice, which said long-standing problems with statutory sick pay meant millions were ineligible or found the payment insufficient to cover essential costs.""People need enough to live on, so they can self-isolate if asked to without fear of being pushed into hardship,"" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive.There have been fears that people told to self-isolate, or who are shielding, could face pressure to return to work by unscrupulous employers.""We've already seen upsetting cases where vulnerable workers have faced the impossible choice of safeguarding their health or continuing to work because they have been denied furlough. We fear that those who need to self-isolate could face similar pressure,"" Ms Guy said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the ""vast majority of people"" would participate in the voluntary system.""In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,"" he said.Northern Ireland has its own version of the test and trace programme already and the scheme in Wales is due to start in early June.",28 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Harrods hits the shopping mall to stop congestion,"Harrods, the upmarket department store, is opening a second outlet in a nearby shopping mall to stop congestion when trading resumes.The new Shepherd's Bush 'concept' store will effectively host Harrods' summer sale across two floors of the Westfield shopping centre from July.""Harrods Outlet allows us to enable better social-distancing across a larger footprint,"" it said Harrods closed its doors in March but plans to re-open on 15 June.The company said it will put ""significant social-distancing measures in place"" at its department store in London's Knightsbridge.It will use footfall monitoring technology to limit capacity with specific doors designated for entering and leaving the shop.But Harrods said the Grade II listed building - built in the 1880s - offered limited flexibility in the light of the crowds expected at its annual summer sale in July.It has therefore developed the new Harrods Outlet concept and will move the majority of the sale items there.Harrods' managing director Michael Ward, said: ""In the new world in which we find ourselves, the economy needs businesses willing to look at its business model and current operations and think differently to enable growth, while protecting its customers and employees.""The concept store - which will only be open temporarily - will sell stock left over from the ""existing season"", Harrods said. ""This move is about capacity,"" said analyst Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics.""With social-distancing in place Harrods won't be able to get enough footfall in its Knightbridge store to clear the overhang of stock they have built up during lockdown.""The 80,000 sq ft two-storey space will give the retailer the opportunity to start with a blank canvas and retro-fit the store with appropriate social-distancing measures, he pointed out.""The economics of running a store have changed but the move shows that there are obviously opportunities for retailers to drive a hard bargain with landlords, even for a short-term let,"" he said.Earlier this year Harrods announced plans to take its core business out of Knightsbridge for the first time, although it has agreed licences for shops at airport terminals and cruise liners in the past.It is launching an H Beauty concept in Lakeside later this year as well as extending its Harrods personal shopping experience in Shanghai at 'The Residence'.In other retail news, sandwich and coffee chain Pret A Manger will re-open more than 200 sites for takeaway and delivery from Monday.It will mean the chain will have re-opened more than 300 stores since lockdown started, although they will offer a limited menu for the moment.Shops will reopen for the first time in towns and cities such as Bath, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Exeter and Liverpool.",28 May 2020,business

News Corp Australia said the move will mean job losses but did not say how many roles would be cut.The coronavirus lockdown has hit advertising revenues, accelerating a downturn in the nation's media sector.The executive chairman of the News Corp operation, Michael Miller, highlighted how the pandemic had hit business: ""Covid-19 has impacted the sustainability of community and regional publishing.""Consequently, to meet these changing trends, we are reshaping News Corp Australia to focus on where consumers and businesses are moving and to strengthen our position as Australia's leading digital news media company.""Under the plan, News Corp's major daily newspapers, including the Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph, will become more state focused, drawing content from regional and community journalists.Larger regional papers, such as the Hobart Mercury or NT News, will continue to be published in their print form.The roots of Mr Murdoch's global empire are in Australian newspapers. But like much of the rest of the world, Australia's traditional media industry has come under under intense pressure in recent years as advertisers turn to internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google.Several media companies in the country have already made cuts or shut down completely during the pandemic, with the latest including Buzzfeed Australia and 10 Daily, a news website of ViacomCBS-owned broadcaster Ten Network.Earlier this year the Australian Associated Press, a newswire which was part-owned by News Corp, announced its closure after 85 years.News Corp has been leading an ongoing campaign to make online firms pay for the Australian content they share.",28 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Vending machine mum's perfect money lesson,"With four children at home, a list of chores, and a secondhand vending machine - one mum may have discovered the perfect lockdown life lesson.Northumberland nurse Sarah Balsdon, 29, was getting so fed up with her children's ""constant arguments"" over sugary snacks, she and husband Kyle devised a plan.She spent £100 on the vending machine being thrown out by a shop that had closed down, and filled it with the family's favourite sweets and drinks.Then she told her four children - Shannon, aged nine, Lucy, eight, Jack, five, and Elijah, two - that they would be paid to do their schoolwork and help with chores around the house.While healthy snacks were free, they could spend their housework income in the vending machine. Their initial reluctance disappeared as the treats began to topple down.""At first I didn't like it,"" Shannon told BBC Breakfast. ""But now I do because I get pop.""Sarah may have landed on a perfect pocket money management course.By working for their cash, saving it, then spending it on their favourite snack, the youngsters have been taught a vital lesson in delayed gratification. Budgeting experts say such a policy would suit many adults too, to avoid getting caught up in a buy now, pay later culture.With Sarah and Kyle also doing chores for their snacks, the family have thrown a bit of competition into the mix as well.Extra time at home offers the perfect opportunity for others to join the Balsdon family in learning more about money, according to Will Carmichael, chief executive of pocket money app RoosterMoney.""Creating a system to help kids earn their money and having tangible visual goals for them to aim at is a brilliant way to help kids focus on a target and learn the value of money,"" he said.""Varying the sizes of the prizes, a brand new Lego set for example, would be a great way to really get them thinking about what they want and what they value.""Source: Money and Pensions ServiceHis company's research on lockdown pocket money suggests children already have some healthy financial habits.Some 40% of pocket money is saved, its survey of 24,000 children suggested. On average, children aged four to 14 receive £4.60 a week.Many have to work for their money, with 70% of chores involving cleaning around the house, topped by cleaning a bedroom, making the bed, and doing the laundry.When they come to spend it, the most goes on digital games platform Roblox, followed by computer game Fortnite, then books and magazines, Lego, and sweets and chocolates.Research by the Money and Pensions Service found that many money habits are formed by the age of seven.Parents carry the biggest influence. Pocket money is one, but not the only, tool they can use in money lessons, especially with most children at home at the moment, according to one financial commentator.Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There are a plenty of ways of introducing money ideas to the kids that can keep them entertained at the same time - and don't require you to have endless reserves of time, patience and creativity.""Some of her ideas include:For those who can afford it, offering to double any money they save can also help them learn about value or saving towards a goal.In the end, that may prove to be more practical than trying to buy a vending machine.",28 May 2020,business
